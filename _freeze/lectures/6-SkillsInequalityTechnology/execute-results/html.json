Measurable cognitive and noncognitive skills explain life-cycle differences\n  2. We can estimate the technology of skill formation (and skills are malleable early in life)\n  3. Latent factor models are essential tools for dealing with measurement error\n- Key papers: @Heckman2006, @Cunha2007, @Cunha2008b\n:::\n\n# Skills and Life-Cycle Inequality\n\n## The Importance of Skills\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Standard human capital theory: education → wages\n- But **which skills** drive labor market outcomes?\n- Two broad categories emerge:\n  - **Cognitive skills**: IQ, achievement tests, reasoning\n  - **Noncognitive skills**: personality, motivation, self-control\n- Question: Do both types matter for economic outcomes?\n:::\n\n## What Do We Mean by Noncognitive Skills?\n\nExamples from psychology literature:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Locus of control**: belief about control over life outcomes\n- **Self-esteem**: confidence in one's abilities\n- **Time preference**: ability to delay gratification\n- **Conscientiousness**: persistence, organization\n- **Emotional stability**: managing stress and emotions\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nThese are often **harder to measure** than cognitive ability, but may be equally important.\n\n## Evidence from Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006)\n\nKey empirical findings using NLSY79 data:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Both cognitive and noncognitive factors significantly affect:\n  - **Wages** (obvious)\n  - **Schooling attainment** (medium)\n  - **Risky behaviors**: smoking, crime, teen pregnancy (large!)\n- For many outcomes, **noncognitive skills matter more** than cognitive\n- The effects persist over the entire life cycle\n:::\n\n## Measuring Skills: The Challenge\n\nHow do we measure cognitive and noncognitive ability?\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Cognitive**: ASVAB battery (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery)\n  - Arithmetic reasoning, word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, etc.\n- **Noncognitive**: Psychological scales\n  - Rotter Locus of Control Scale\n  - Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale\n- Problem: **Measurement error!**\n  - Tests are noisy proxies for true underlying ability\n  - Cannot simply use test scores as if they were true ability\n:::\n\n## Wages by Schooling and Cognitive Factor\n\nFrom @Heckman2006:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Higher cognitive ability → higher wages **at all schooling levels**\n- But the **gradient is steeper** for college graduates\n- This suggests **complementarity** between skills and education\n- Cognitive skills have bigger payoffs with more schooling\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n*[Figure would show wage distributions by cognitive factor quintiles and schooling level]*\n\n## Wages by Schooling and Noncognitive Factor\n\nFrom @Heckman2006:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Noncognitive skills **also** predict wages\n- The pattern is similar: higher noncognitive ability → higher wages\n- Effects are **large and persistent**\n- For some outcomes (e.g., crime), noncognitive effects **dominate** cognitive\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n*[Figure would show wage distributions by noncognitive factor quintiles and schooling level]*\n\n## Educational Attainment and Skills\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Both cognitive and noncognitive skills predict years of schooling\n- **Noncognitive skills are particularly important** for college completion\n  - Requires persistence, motivation, delayed gratification\n- This helps explain the Becker-Tomes \"psychic costs\"\n  - Not just ability to do the work\n  - Also willingness to persist, study habits, etc.\n:::\n\n# The Technology of Skill Formation\n\n## Skills Are Produced\n\nFrom the Becker-Tomes model, we had:\n$$ H_{t+1} = f(I_t, \\theta_t) $$\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- But what is the **technology** $f(\\cdot)$?\n- How do cognitive and noncognitive skills interact?\n- Are there **critical periods** for investment?\n- Can we compensate for early disadvantage with late investment?\n:::\n\n## The CES Technology of Skill Formation\n\nFrom @Cunha2007, the technology takes the form:\n\n$$\n\\theta_{k,t+1} = \\left[\\gamma_{1k}I_{k,t}^{\\phi_k} + \\gamma_{2k}\\theta_{k,t}^{\\phi_k}\\right]^{1/\\phi_k}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- $\\theta_{k,t}$ is skill $k$ (cognitive or noncognitive) at age $t$\n- $I_{k,t}$ is investment in skill $k$ at age $t$\n- $\\phi_k$ governs **substitutability** between early and late investments\n- This is a **self-productive** technology: skills today produce skills tomorrow\n:::\n\n## Key Parameters: Elasticity of Substitution\n\nThe **elasticity of substitution** is:\n$$ \\sigma_k = \\frac{1}{1-\\phi_k} $$\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- If $\\sigma_k$ is **high**: early and late investments are **substitutes**\n  - Can compensate for poor early environment with later remediation\n- If $\\sigma_k$ is **low**: early and late investments are **complements**\n  - Early investment is crucial; hard to compensate later\n- Empirical question: What are $\\sigma_{\\text{cog}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{noncog}}$?\n:::\n\n## Self-Productivity and Dynamic Complementarity\n\nTwo key properties:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. **Self-productivity**: $\\frac{\\partial \\theta_{k,t+1}}{\\partial \\theta_{k,t}} > 0$\n   - Skills beget skills\n   - Early advantage compounds over time\n2. **Dynamic complementarity**: $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\theta_{k,t+1}}{\\partial I_{k,t} \\partial \\theta_{k,t}} > 0$\n   - Early skills make later investments more productive\n   - This creates **multiplier effects**\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nThese properties have profound implications for policy timing.\n\n## Critical and Sensitive Periods\n\nFrom @Cunha2007:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Critical period**: A time when $\\sigma_k \\approx 0$ (pure complements)\n  - Investment **must** happen then; cannot compensate later\n- **Sensitive period**: A time when $\\sigma_k$ is low but not zero\n  - Investment is especially productive, but some later compensation possible\n- Evidence: **Early childhood is a sensitive period** for both skill types\n- But noncognitive skills remain more malleable into adolescence\n:::\n\n## The Importance of Early Investment\n\nKey finding from @Cunha2007:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- For cognitive skills: $\\sigma_{\\text{cog}}$ is **low** in early childhood\n  - Early investments are crucial\n  - Difficult to compensate for early deprivation\n- For noncognitive skills: $\\sigma_{\\text{noncog}}$ is somewhat **higher**\n  - More room for remediation in adolescence\n  - But still important to invest early\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Policy implication**: Early childhood interventions may have the highest returns.\n\n## Cross-Productivity of Skills\n\nAnother important feature from @Cunha2008b:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta_{C,t+1}}{\\partial \\theta_{N,t}} > 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\theta_{N,t+1}}{\\partial \\theta_{C,t}} > 0\n$$\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Cognitive skills help produce noncognitive skills (and vice versa)\n- This creates **synergies** across skill dimensions\n- Holistic interventions may be more effective than targeted ones\n:::\n\n# Latent Factor Models and Measurement Error\n\n## The Measurement Problem\n\nFundamental challenge:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- We want to study the effect of **true skills** $\\theta$ on outcomes $Y$\n- But we only observe **noisy measures** $M$ of skills\n- If we use $M$ instead of $\\theta$:\n  - **Attenuation bias**: underestimate true effects\n  - **Omitted variable bias**: if measures are imperfect proxies\n- Classical measurement error: $M = \\theta + \\varepsilon$\n  - Bias toward zero: $\\text{plim}\\,\\hat{\\beta} = \\beta \\frac{\\text{Var}(\\theta)}{\\text{Var}(\\theta) + \\text{Var}(\\varepsilon)}$\n:::\n\n## The Latent Factor Approach\n\nKey idea from @Heckman2006:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. Assume there are $K$ latent factors $\\theta = (\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_K)$\n2. We observe $J$ measurements $M = (M_1, \\ldots, M_J)$\n3. Each measurement loads on the factors:\n   $$ M_j = \\mu_j + \\sum_{k=1}^K \\alpha_{jk}\\theta_k + \\varepsilon_j $$\n4. Use **multiple measures** to identify the factors\n5. Correct for measurement error in estimating effects on outcomes\n:::\n\n## Factor Model Structure {.smaller}\n\nThe system has three components:\n\n**Measurement equations**:\n$$ M_j = \\mu_j + \\alpha_{j1}\\theta_1 + \\alpha_{j2}\\theta_2 + \\varepsilon_j, \\quad j = 1, \\ldots, J $$\n\n**Outcome equations**:\n$$ Y = X\\beta + \\gamma_1\\theta_1 + \\gamma_2\\theta_2 + u $$\n\n**Choice equations**:\n$$ S = \\mathbb{1}[Z\\delta + \\lambda_1\\theta_1 + \\lambda_2\\theta_2 + v > 0] $$\n\nwhere $\\theta_1, \\theta_2$ are latent factors (e.g., cognitive and noncognitive ability).\n\n## Identification Strategy\n\nHow do we identify this model?\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. **Normalizations**: Set scale of factors\n   - E.g., $\\alpha_{11} = 1$, $\\alpha_{22} = 1$\n2. **Exclusion restrictions**: Some measurements don't load on all factors\n   - Cognitive tests only load on $\\theta_1$\n   - Personality scales only load on $\\theta_2$\n3. **Multiple measurements**: Need $J \\geq 2K + 1$ typically\n4. **Covariance structure**: Factor model implies testable restrictions\n:::\n\n## What the Factor Model Buys Us\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. **Correct inference** about effects of skills on outcomes\n   - No attenuation bias from measurement error\n2. **Decomposition** of outcomes into skill components\n   - How much is due to cognitive vs. noncognitive?\n3. **Predicted factors** for each individual\n   - Can use in subsequent analysis\n4. **Tests of model assumptions**\n   - Overidentification restrictions\n:::\n\n## Example: NLSY79 Data\n\n@Heckman2006 use:\n\n**Cognitive measurements**:\n- ASVAB: Arithmetic reasoning, word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, math knowledge, coding speed\n\n**Noncognitive measurements**:\n- Rotter Locus of Control Scale\n- Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale\n\n. . .\n\nWith two factors and multiple measures, the model is **overidentified** and can be tested.\n\n## Estimating the Factor Distribution\n\nKey methodological point from @Cunha2007:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Traditional factor analysis assumes **normal** factors\n- But factors may be **non-normal** in reality\n- Solution: Use **mixture of normals**\n  $$ f(\\theta_k) = \\sum_{j=1}^{J_k} p_{kj} \\phi(\\theta_k | \\mu_{kj}, \\sigma_{kj}^2) $$\n- This is flexible and nests normality as a special case\n- Allows for skewness, multimodality, etc.\n:::\n\n## Separating Heterogeneity from Uncertainty\n\nAnother key use of factor models (from the @Cunha2007 paper):\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Observed wage variance has two sources:\n  1. **Heterogeneity**: differences in $\\theta$ known to agent at age 17\n  2. **Uncertainty**: shocks $\\varepsilon$ unknown at age 17\n- Factor model + choice data lets us **separate these**\n- How? If $\\theta \\in I$ (agent's info set), it affects **choices**\n- If $\\varepsilon \\notin I$, it doesn't affect choices\n- By using choice data, we learn what agents knew when\n:::\n\n## Findings on Predictability\n\nFrom @Cunha2007:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- About **80% of lifetime earnings variance** is predictable at age 17\n- Only **20%** is due to genuine uncertainty (\"luck\")\n- Most inequality is due to **heterogeneity** in skills\n- This heterogeneity is **measurable** using factor methods\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Implication**: Early interventions can have large effects because most variance is in place early.\n\n# Synthesis and Policy Implications\n\n## Bringing It Together\n\nWhat have we learned?\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. **Both** cognitive and noncognitive skills matter enormously\n2. Noncognitive skills are often **more important** than we thought\n3. Skills have a **production technology** with:\n   - Self-productivity\n   - Dynamic complementarity\n   - Low substitutability early in life\n4. **Measurement error** is severe; factor models are essential\n5. Most earnings inequality is **heterogeneity** (not luck)\n:::\n\n## Policy Implications {.smaller}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. **Invest early**: Critical and sensitive periods suggest high returns to early childhood\n2. **Holistic interventions**: Target both cognitive and noncognitive skills\n3. **Compensatory programs**: May need to be **very early** due to low substitutability\n4. **Measurement matters**:\n   - Policy evaluations need to account for measurement error\n   - Standard approaches may severely understate program effects\n5. **Targeting**: Focus on children from disadvantaged backgrounds\n   - They face both low $\\theta$ and low $I$\n   - Dynamic complementarity means early intervention is most effective for them\n:::\n\n## The Perry Preschool Program\n\nA famous example: @heckman2010\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- High-quality preschool for disadvantaged 3-4 year olds\n- **Large, persistent effects** on:\n  - Educational attainment\n  - Earnings\n  - Crime reduction\n- Effects work through **both cognitive and noncognitive** channels\n- But **noncognitive effects persist** while cognitive fade\n- Illustrates importance of early, comprehensive intervention\n:::\n\n## Remaining Questions\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Which** noncognitive skills are most malleable?\n- **How** do parental investments respond to child skills?\n  - Reinforcing or compensating?\n- **Can** we remediate in adolescence?\n  - Evidence suggests yes for noncognitive, harder for cognitive\n- **What policies** are most cost-effective?\n- How do skills interact with **institutions** (schools, labor markets)?\n:::\n\n## Next Steps\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Next lectures will explore:\n  - Quantitative models of intergenerational mobility\n  - Parenting and investments\n  - Policy evaluation: ECE, safety net, etc.\n- We'll use the framework developed today as a foundation\n- Recurring theme: **Dynamic complementarity** makes timing crucial\n:::\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. Skills are **multidimensional**: cognitive and noncognitive both matter\n2. Skills are **produced** according to a technology with important properties\n3. **Early life** is a critical period due to low substitutability\n4. **Measurement error** is a first-order problem; factor models solve it\n5. Most inequality is **heterogeneity**, not luck\n6. **Policy**: Invest early, invest holistically, target disadvantaged\n:::\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n",
