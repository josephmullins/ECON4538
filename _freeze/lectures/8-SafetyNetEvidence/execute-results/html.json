Do income transfers affect child development?\n  - What are the long-run effects on education and earnings?\n  - How do these findings connect to our theoretical models?\n:::\n\n## A Brief Recap\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- We found that for unconstrained households, optimal investments *are not* affected by economic resources.\n  - Finding effects of resources / interventions, a sign of constraints $\\Rightarrow$ welfare and efficiency gains\n- But would it be a good idea to simply do OLS?\n$$ \\log(H_{t+1}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}\\log(\\Omega_{t}) + \\epsilon_{t} $$\n- No!! e.g. $z_{t-1}\\rightarrow \\Omega$ and $z_{t}\\rightarrow H_{t+1}$\n- Must look for *experimental* and *quasi-experimental* evidence\n:::\n\n# The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)\n\n## What is the EITC?\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Refundable tax credit for low-income working families\n- Phases in with earnings, plateaus, then phases out\n- For families with children, substantial benefits (max ~$7,000)\n- Key features:\n  - Conditional on working (labor supply incentive)\n  - Varies with number of children\n  - Expanded significantly in 1993\n- A few ways to use this variation\n:::\n\n## EITC Schedule\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Three regions:\n  1. **Phase-in**: credit increases with earnings\n  2. **Plateau**: credit remains constant\n  3. **Phase-out**: credit decreases with earnings\n- Creates variation in income while holding work incentives roughly constant\n:::\n\n# Dahl and Lochner (2012)\n\n## Research Question\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Does family income *causally* affect child achievement?\n- Previous research showed correlations, but hard to separate:\n  - Direct income effect\n  - Selection (parents with higher income have other advantages)\n- **Innovation**: use EITC expansions as exogenous income shocks\n- Focus on test scores as outcomes\n:::\n\n## Identification Strategy {.smaller}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Compare children in families eligible for large vs small EITC increases\n- Key variation: 1993 EITC expansion differentially affected families by initial earnings level\n- Use *predicted income growth* conditional on earnings as an instrument for *actual income growth*\n- To use this variation, must also control for initial earnings\n:::\n\n## Main Results {.smaller}\n\nFrom [@Dahl2012]:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Effect size**: $1,000 increase in income → 6% of standard deviation increase in test scores\n- Effects concentrated in math and reading\n- Larger effects for:\n  - Younger children\n  - More disadvantaged families\n:::\n\n# Bastian and Michelmore (2018)\n\n## Long-Run Effects of EITC\n\n[@Bastian2018] ask: what are the **lifetime** impacts of EITC exposure?\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Follow children exposed to EITC expansions into adulthood\n- Outcomes:\n  - Educational attainment\n  - Employment\n  - Earnings\n- **Key insight**: childhood income may have persistent effects\n:::\n\n## Identification Strategy\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Exploit state-level EITC programs (additional to federal)\n- Timing: states adopted at different times\n- Compare children in same state, different birth cohorts\n- State, year, family size $\\rightarrow$ different max credit\n:::\n\n## Variation in EITC Exposure\n\n![](../papers/figures/bastian2018_fig2.png){width=75%}\n\nSource: [@Bastian2018, Figure 2]\n\n## Specification {.smaller}\n\n$$ Y_{i} = \\beta_{1}EITC_{i,0-5} + \\beta_{2}EITC_{i,6-12} + \\beta_{3}EITC_{i,13-18} + \\eta X_{i} + \\psi V_{s,t} + \\lambda Z_{s} + \\pi W_{t} + \\epsilon_{i} $$\n\n- $EITC_{i,-}$: maximum available EITC credit given state, year, family size\n- $X_{i}$: family characteristics\n- $Z_{s}$: state fixed effects\n- $W_{t}$: year fixed effects\n- $V_{s,t}$: state-year policy variables\n\n## Main Findings {.smaller}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- $1,000 increase in EITC exposure (**age 13-18**) leads to:\n  - 1.3 percentage point increase in high school completion\n  - Higher college attendance\n  - 2% increase in earnings in mid-20s\n- The EITC is a **work incentive** and had an effect on maternal labor supply\n  - Changes in money **and** time with children\n:::\n\n# Barr, Eggleston, and Smith (2022)\n\n## Tax Benefits and the Birthday Lottery\n\n[@Barr2022] exploit a natural experiment: the January 1 birthdate cutoff\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- U.S. child tax benefits determined by December 31 cutoff\n- Child born December 31 → family gets full tax year benefits\n- Child born January 1 → family waits a year for benefits\n- **Natural randomization**: due date doesn't predict birth date precisely\n- Average difference: ~$1,300 for low-income families (~10% of annual income)\n:::\n\n## The Cash Transfer Discontinuity\n\n![](../papers/figures/barr2021_fig1.png){width=80%}\n\nSource: [@Barr2022, Figure I]\n\n## Research Question\n\nDo cash transfers in the first year of life affect long-run child outcomes?\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Focus: transfer received (or not) right after birth\n- Compare children born just before vs just after January 1\n- **Innovation**: use universe of administrative tax data\n- Follow children into adulthood (measure earnings in 20s)\n- Also examine intermediate outcomes (test scores, graduation)\n:::\n\n## Identification Strategy {.smaller}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Key assumption**: children born Dec 31 vs Jan 1 are similar except for transfer timing\n- Potential threats:\n  - C-sections scheduled to manipulate birth date?\n  - **Response**: show no bunching around January 1\n  - Different demographics around cutoff?\n  - **Response**: show balance on observables\n- Window: focus on births within days of cutoff\n:::\n\n## Main Results {.smaller}\n\nChildren who received ~$1,300 transfer in first year show:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Long-run earnings**: 1-2% higher at age 20-25\n  - Larger effects for males (3-4%)\n  - Concentrated among low-income families\n- **Intermediate outcomes**:\n  - Higher math and reading test scores\n  - Increased high school graduation rates\n- Effects emerge early and persist\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Return on investment**: $1,300 transfer yields increased lifetime earnings far exceeding cost\n\n## Effect on Adult Earnings\n\n![](../papers/figures/barr2021_fig3.png){width=75%}\n\nSource: [@Barr2022, Figure III]\n\n## Mechanisms and Timing\n\nWhy do transfers in infancy matter?\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Critical period**: first year of life is developmentally important\n  - Brain development\n  - Nutrition and health\n  - Parent-child bonding\n- Families may be especially credit-constrained after birth\n- Small amounts can have large effects if spent on high-return investments\n:::\n\n## Effects grow with age\n\n![](../papers/figures/barr2021_fig5.png){width=75%}\n\nSource: [@Barr2022, Figure V]\n\n## Effect on Test Scores (North Carolina)\n\n![](../papers/figures/barr2021_fig7.png){width=75%}\n\nSource: [@Barr2022, Figure VII]\n\n# Food Stamps: Bailey et al. (2024)\n\n## The Food Stamp Program\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- In-kind transfer program (now called SNAP)\n- Provides food benefits to low-income households\n- Rolled out county-by-county between 1961-1975\n- **Research opportunity**: quasi-experimental variation in timing of access\n:::\n\n## Food Stamp Program Rollout\n\n![](../papers/figures/bailey2024_fig1.png){width=70%}\n\nSource: [@bailey2024, Figure 1]\n\n## Bailey et al. (2024) Study Design\n\n[@bailey2024] leverage rollout timing:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Compare cohorts born just before vs just after Food Stamps arrived\n- Within-county variation in exposure by birth year\n- Link historical rollout data to modern outcomes\n- **Long-run outcomes**: health, education, economic self-sufficiency in adulthood\n:::\n\n## Specification {.smaller}\n$$ Y_{cbt} = \\theta_{c} + \\delta_{s(c)b} + \\psi_{t} + X_{cb}\\beta + \\sum_{a=-5}^{a=17}\\mathbf{1}\\{FS_{c}-b = a\\} + \\epsilon_{cbt} $$\n\n- $c$: county\n- $b$: birth year\n- $t$: year of observation\n- $FS_{c}$: year in which country $c$ gets FS program\n- $X_{cb}$ :county-by-birth year covariates\n\n## Logic of Study Design\n\n![](../papers/figures/bailey2024_fig2.png){width=75%}\n\n## Main Findings {.smaller}\n\nChildhood access to Food Stamps led to:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Health**: reduced metabolic syndrome, obesity in adulthood\n- **Education**: increased high school completion\n- **Economic**: higher earnings, less likely to receive government assistance\n- **Intergenerational**: children of treated individuals have better outcomes\n- Effects larger for:\n  - More disadvantaged families\n  - Exposure during early childhood and in utero\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Interpretation**: nutrition and food security in childhood have lifelong consequences\n\n## Event Study: Example\n\n![](../papers/figures/bailey2024_fig3.png){width=75%}\n\nSource: [@bailey2024, Figure 3]\n\n## Return on Investment\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Authors calculate cost-benefit ratio\n- Benefits from:\n  - Higher earnings (increased tax revenue)\n  - Better health (lower medical costs)\n  - Less transfer receipt (lower government spending)\n- Find ROI of approximately 56 cents per dollar spent\n- **Interpretation**: Food Stamps are an *investment* not just consumption\n:::\n\n# Carneiro et al. (2021): Nigeria Cash Transfer Program\n\n## The Child Development Grant Programme (CDGP)\n\n[@Carneiro2021] study a multifaceted intervention in Northern Nigeria:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Information provision to mothers and fathers on pregnancy and infant feeding practices\n- **Cash transfers** to mothers: $22/month (85% of women's earnings)\n- Transfers begin during pregnancy, continue until child is 24 months\n- Implemented at village level, targeted to pregnant women\n- Randomized controlled trial with 3,688 pregnant women at baseline\n:::\n\n## Why This Context Matters\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Northern Nigeria: extreme poverty (70% below $1.90/day)\n- High stunting rates (67% of children under 5)\n- Infant mortality: 90 per 1,000 births\n- Low knowledge of child nutrition practices\n- Women retain control over resources they bring into household\n- Agricultural lean season creates food insecurity\n:::\n\n## Main Results {.smaller}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Child anthropometrics** (2 years post-intervention):\n  - Height-for-age Z-score increases by 0.22σ\n  - Stunting reduced by 8%, extreme stunting by 15%\n  - Effects sustained at 4 years\n- **Child health**:\n  - 18% reduction in diarrhea episodes\n  - Increased vaccination and deworming rates\n- **Mother's labor supply**:\n  - 21% increase in earnings at 2 years, sustained at 4 years\n  - Increased livestock ownership (key for protein-rich diets)\n- **Cognition**\n  - Effect on communication, but fade-out\n:::\n\n## Effect on Food Consumption\n\n![](../papers/figures/carneiro2021_fig3.png){width=75%}\n\nSource: [@Carneiro2021, Figure 3]\n\n## Effect on Resources\n\n![](../papers/figures/carneiro2021_fig4.png){width=75%}\n\nSource: [@Carneiro2021, Figure 4]\n\n## Long-Run Impacts and Mechanisms\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Key mechanisms**:\n  - Increased parental knowledge and improved practices (breastfeeding, antenatal care)\n  - Women invest transfers in livestock assets → protein-rich foods for children\n  - Labor supply increases (no reduction despite transfers)\n  - Food security improves, especially during lean season\n- **Sustained effects**: impacts persist 2 years after transfers end\n- **Return on investment**: Internal rate of return 5-20% depending on assumptions\n:::\n\n## Interpreting Through Our Models\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Becker-Tomes: intervention relaxes budget constraints AND provides information\n- Evidence of binding credit constraints for low-income families\n- Technology of skill formation (Cunha-Heckman):\n  - Early investments matter (impacts on gestation, early nutrition)\n  - Multiple inputs: cash enables protein-rich foods, better practices\n  - Dynamic complementarity: early health + continued investment\n- **Unique insight**: Cash transfers enable productive investments (livestock) that generate sustained income\n:::\n\n# Synthesis and Implications\n\n## What Have We Learned? {.smaller}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. **Income matters**: Causal evidence from EITC, PFD, Food Stamps\n2. **Timing is critical**: Largest effects for early childhood exposure\n3. **Long-run effects**: Childhood resources affect adult outcomes\n4. **Multiple channels**: Income, information, parenting, health all matter\n5. **Intergenerational**: Effects potentially transmit to next generation\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Policy implication**: Safety net programs are investments in human capital, not just transfers\n\n## Connecting to Theory {.smaller}\n\nThese findings validate and extend our models:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Credit constraints bind**: low-income families would invest more if they could\n- **Self-productivity**: early investments have compounding returns\n- **Dynamic complementarity**: nutrition, health, cognitive stimulation interact\n- **Multiple skills**: cognitive and non-cognitive both affected\n- **Intergenerational transmission**: improved child outcomes → improved parenting → next generation\n:::\n\n. . .\n\nWhere do the models need refinement?\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- More explicit modeling of multiple input types\n- Better understanding of production function non-linearities\n- Behavioral aspects (information, salience, planning)\n:::\n\n## Remaining Questions\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Mechanisms**: exactly how does income translate to better outcomes?\n  - Direct purchases (food, books, healthcare)\n  - Parental time allocation\n  - Stress reduction\n  - Neighborhood quality\n- **Optimal design**: conditional vs unconditional? cash vs in-kind?\n- **General equilibrium**: what if everyone receives transfers?\n- **Cost-effectiveness**: which interventions have highest returns?\n:::\n\n",
