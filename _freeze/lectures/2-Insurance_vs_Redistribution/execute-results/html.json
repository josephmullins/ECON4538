\\mathbb{E}[u(y)] = u(0.5\\bar{c}_{L}+0.5\\bar{c}_{H}) - 0.5u(\\bar{c}_{L}) - 0.5u(\\bar{c}_{H})$$ \nis a measure of the **gains from redistribution** when uncertainty is removed via certainty equivalence\n:::\n\n## Example 1: A decomposition \n\n:::{.incremental}\n- $u(C^*) - u(\\bar{C})$ is likewise a measure of the **gains from insurance** derived from valuing gains in certainty equivalents.\n- This gives a decomposition:\n$$ W_{1} - W_{0} = \\underbrace{u(C^*) - u(\\bar{C})}_{\\text{insurance}} + \\underbrace{u(\\bar{C}) - \\mathbb{E}[u(y)]}_{\\text{redistribution}} $$\n- **Exercises**:\n    - Calculate the decomposition with log utility\n    - Look at how it changes with $\\pi$\n:::\n\n## Example 1: picturing the decomposition\n\n\n## Example 2: a dynamic economy\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Assume same type structure, $\\tau(i)\\in\\{L,H}$ for all agents $i$\n- But now infinite horizon, $t=0,1,2,...,\\infty$\n- $\\log(y_{it}) = \\mu_{\\tau(i)} + \\varepsilon_{it}$,\\ $\\varepsilon_{it}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$, $\\mu_{L}<\\mu_{H}$ \n- Benchmark: no private insurance markets, $c_{it} = y_{it}$.\n- $V_{i} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty u(c_{it})\\right]\n:::\n\n## Example 2\n\n**Exercises**:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Derive $V_{\\tau}$ for each type in benchmark\n- Solve planner's problem\n- Derive decomposition\n- Analyze decomposition as $\\mu_{L}\\rightarrow\\mu_{H}$, $\\sigma^2\\rightarrow0$\n:::\n\n## Example 3\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- same economy as example (2), **except** assume that individuals can insure against $\\varepsilon_{it}$, i.e. in the benchmark for all $i$, $t$:\n$$ c_{it} = \\exp\\left(\\mu_{\\tau(i)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right) $$\n- What does the decomposition look like in this case?\n:::\n\n## Example 4\nA harder exercise for you try.\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Assume\n$$ y_{it} = \\mu + \\rho(y_{it-1} - \\mu) + \\zeta_{it},\\ \\ \\zeta_{it}\\sim{N}(0,\\sigma^2_{\\zeta}) $$\n- No borrowing or saving (consume $y_{it}$).\n:::\n\n# Application: Storesletten, Telmer & Yaron (2004)\n\n## Overview: @Storesletten2004 {.smaller}\n\n**Main Question**: Can individual earnings risk explain why consumption and income inequality increase with age?\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Key Finding**: Yes! An overlapping generations model with uninsurable earnings shocks can account for:\n  - Both earnings and consumption inequality over the life cycle\n  - The fact that consumption inequality increases less than earnings inequality\n- **Data Sources**:\n  - Earnings: Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), 1969-1992\n  - Consumption: Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), 1980-1990\n:::\n\n## The Empirical Facts {.smaller}\n\n![Figure 1 from @Storesletten2004: Cross-sectional variance of log earnings and consumption by age](../papers/figures/sty_fig1.png){width=70%}\n\nThree striking patterns in U.S. data:\n\n1. **Both earnings and consumption inequality increase substantially with age** (ages 23-60)\n2. **Consumption inequality rises less than earnings inequality**\n3. **Both increase approximately linearly** over working years\n\n**Interpretation**: Imperfect risk sharing - something between complete markets and autarky\n\n## Is It Just Predetermined Skills? {.smaller}\n\n![Figure 2 from @Storesletten2004: Inequality by education group](../papers/figures/sty_fig2.png){width=75%}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- If inequality were just about predetermined skills, we'd see flat profiles **within** education groups\n- But we see rising inequality **within** each education group!\n- This supports the \"shocks\" story over the \"skills\" story\n- Even controlling for broad skill measures, idiosyncratic risk matters\n:::\n\n## The Earnings Process {.smaller}\n\nLog earnings for household $i$ at age $h$:\n$$ \\log(n_{ih}) = \\kappa_h + \\alpha_i + z_{ih} + \\varepsilon_{ih} $$\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- $\\kappa_h$: deterministic age profile\n- $\\alpha_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_\\alpha)$: **fixed effect** (realized at birth, permanent)\n- $z_{ih}$: **persistent shock**: $z_{ih} = \\rho z_{i,h-1} + \\eta_{ih}$, where $\\eta_{ih} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_\\eta)$\n- $\\varepsilon_{ih} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_\\varepsilon)$: **transitory shock** (i.i.d.)\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Key Estimate**: $\\rho \\approx 0.999$ (near unit root!)\n\n## Why Near Unit-Root Persistence? {.smaller}\n\n![Figure 3 from @Storesletten2004: Model fit to earnings inequality profile](../papers/figures/sty_fig3.png){width=65%}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- The **linear** shape of the age-variance profile is crucial\n- Lower persistence (ρ < 0.95) would generate **concave** profiles\n- Near unit-root (ρ ≈ 1) generates the linear pattern we see in data\n- This is a robust finding across different specifications\n:::\n\n## The Model: Key Features {.smaller}\n\n**Overlapping Generations Economy**:\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- Agents live ages 22-100, retire at 65\n- Face uninsurable idiosyncratic earnings shocks\n- Can save/borrow via a single asset (capital)\n- Pay-as-you-go social security system\n- **General equilibrium**: aggregate wealth is endogenous\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Calibration Strategy**:\n- Match aggregate wealth/income ratio = 3.1 (for bottom 99%)\n- Match earnings process to PSID data\n- Check if model matches consumption inequality from CEX\n\n## Main Results {.smaller}\n\n![Figure 4 from @Storesletten2004: Model predictions for consumption inequality](../papers/figures/sty_fig4.png){width=70%}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n- **Model matches earnings inequality by construction** (calibration target)\n- **Benchmark (no social security)**: 20% too much consumption inequality\n- **With social security**: Nearly perfect match!\n- Social security's concave replacement rate provides implicit insurance within generations\n:::\n\n## The Role of Wealth {.smaller}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n**Aggregate wealth is crucial for risk sharing**:\n\n- More wealth → more buffer-stock savings → more consumption smoothing\n- Model calibrated to match U.S. wealth/income ratio = 3.1\n\n**Experiment**: Reduce wealth/income ratio from 3.1 to 1.5\n- Result: Consumption inequality ↑ by 17%\n- Would need 36% (vs. 20%) reduction in shock variances to match data\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Implication**: General equilibrium matters! The amount of self-insurance feasible depends critically on economy-wide wealth accumulation.\n\n## Insurance vs. Redistribution Decomposition {.smaller}\n\n**Key Welfare Question**: Which matters more?\n\n1. **Fixed effects** ($\\alpha_i$): Inequality determined at birth\n2. **Life-cycle shocks** ($z_{ih}, \\varepsilon_{ih}$): Shocks received during working years\n\n. . .\n\n**Results**:\n\n| Type of Risk | Welfare Cost (% of consumption) |\n|--------------|--------------------------------|\n| Life-cycle shocks | **27.4%** |\n| Fixed effects | **20.2%** |\n\n. . .\n\n**Comparison with Keane & Wolpin (1997)**:\n- They found: 90% of lifetime utility variance from fixed effects\n- STY (2004): Only 47% from fixed effects\n\n## Policy Implications {.smaller}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. **Life-cycle shocks are important for welfare**\n   - Not just predetermined heterogeneity!\n   - Buffer-stock savings and precautionary behavior matter\n\n2. **Social security provides valuable insurance**\n   - Concave replacement rate redistributes within generations\n   - Accounts for ~1.6% of lifetime consumption in welfare gains\n\n3. **Policy design matters**\n   - Insurance against life-cycle shocks is as important as addressing inequality at birth\n   - Both pre-labor market interventions (education) AND insurance mechanisms (social security, unemployment insurance) are valuable\n:::\n\n## Conclusion: What We Learned {.smaller}\n\n:::{.incremental}\n1. **Empirical**: Earnings shocks are highly persistent (ρ ≈ 1)\n   - This is necessary to match linear increase in inequality\n\n2. **Theoretical**: Incomplete markets model can quantitatively account for consumption inequality over life cycle\n   - Key ingredients: persistent shocks + calibrated wealth + social security\n\n3. **Normative**: Life-cycle uncertainty is at least as important as fixed heterogeneity\n   - Challenges the view that all inequality is predetermined\n   - Supports role for insurance mechanisms and financial markets\n\n4. **Methodological**: Age profiles of inequality are informative about risk sharing\n   - Rising consumption inequality → imperfect insurance\n   - General equilibrium + quantitative calibration crucial\n:::\n\n",
