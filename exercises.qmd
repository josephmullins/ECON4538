## Example 3

- same economy as example (2), **except** assume that individuals can insure against $\varepsilon_{it}$, i.e. in the benchmark for all $i$, $t$:
$$ c_{it} = \exp\left(\mu_{\tau(i)} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right) $$
- What does the decomposition look like in this case?

## Example 4 (harder.. could make it easier)
- Assume
$$ y_{it} = \mu + \rho(y_{it-1} - \mu) + \zeta_{it},\ \ \zeta_{it}\sim{N}(0,\sigma^2_{\zeta}) $$
- No borrowing or saving (consume $y_{it}$).

## Exercise 4: Permanent vs Transitory

Consider a model with both components:

$$y_{it} = p_{it} + e_{it}$$

where $p_{it} = p_{it-1} + \zeta_{it}$ and $e_{it} = \theta e_{it-1} + \varepsilon_{it}$

**Questions**:

a) Which component determines long-run inequality?
b) Which component affects year-to-year volatility?
c) What is the covariance in growth rates?
d) How can we estimate this model

## Exercise 5: Random walk + MA(1)

$$y_{it} = p_{it} + \varepsilon_{it} + \theta \varepsilon_{i,t-1}$$

a) What is the covariance in growth rates?
b) How can we estimate this model?

## Note:

We can re-write the exercises above by changing the initial conditions (going from stationary to non-stationary)
