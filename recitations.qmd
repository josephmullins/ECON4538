title: "Recitation Materials"

Materials will be updated here as we continue through the course.

These recitations have been rendered using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) notebooks. The original source files for the notebooks can be downloaded from this site's [Github repo](https://github.com/josephmullins/ECON4538). You may want to study the source files to learn how to format your own notebooks for the homework assignments.
