## Overview

:::{.incremental}
- We documented that inequality is increasing in the US
- We don't yet have a model to think about policy implications
- A natural policy to consider is **taxes** and **transfers**
- Look at planner's problem
- Distinguish between **insurance** vs **redistribution** effects
- Look at a research application: @Storesletten2004

# Redistribution vs Insurance

## Example 1: Static Economy

:::{.incremental}
- One period economy
- Two types of agent: $\tau\in\{L,H\}$ (equal proportions)
- Uncertain income: $\{y_{L},y_{H}\}$, $y_{L}<y_{H}$
- Distributions: $\{\pi,1-\pi\}$ for low type, $\{1-\pi,\pi\}$ for high type, $\pi>0.5$. 
- Concave utility $u(\cdot)$
- No insurance market:
$$ V_{L} = \mathbb{E}[u(y)|L] = \pi u(y_{L}) + (1-\pi) u(y_{H})$$
and symmetric for $V_{H}$.
:::

## Example 1: Planner's Problem {.smaller}
:::{.incremental}
- Let $c(\tau,y)$ be consumption of type $\tau$ when income $y$ is realized.
- Planner's objective:
$$ W = \mathbb{E}[u(c(\tau,y))] = 0.5\mathbb{E}[u(c(L,y))|L] + 0.5\mathbb{E}[u(c(H,y))|H] $$
- In the laissez-faire economy:
$$ W_{0} = 0.5u(y_{L}) + 0.5u(y_{H}) $$
- Planner's problem:
$$\max_{c(\tau,y)}\mathbb{E}[u(c(\tau,y))]\ s.t. \mathbb{E}[c(\tau,y)] = 0.5y_{L} + 0.5y_{H} $$
- **Exercise**: show that $c^*(\tau,y) = 0.5y_{L} + 0.5y_{H}$
:::

## Example 1: Welfare Gains
picture here of welfare gains

## Example 1:

:::{.incremental}
- Something to notice: planner cares only about average utility, doesn't care about changes in $V_{H}$ and $V_{L}$
- **Exercise**: study changes in $V_{\tau}$ for different values of $\pi$
- Redistribution and insurance effects are **bundled together**
- How to separate?
- Define **certainty equivalent**:
$$ u(\bar{c}_{\tau}) = \mathbb{E}[u(c)|\tau],\ \tau\in\{L,H\}$$
:::

## Example 1: Static Economy
Exercises:

:::{.incremental}
- Show that $c^*(\tau,y) = 0.5y_{L} + 0.5y_{L}$ (perfect smoothing)
- Define consumption equivalent:
$$ \mathbb{E}u(c^*(\tau,y)) = \mathbb{E}u((1+\omega)y) $$
as a measure of welfare gain
- Define **certainty equivalent**:
$$ u(\bar{c}_{\tau}) = \mathbb{E}_{\tau}u(y) $$ 
for each type $\tau$.
- Interpretation: guaranteed consumption that would deliver same value
:::

## Example 1: Gains from redistribution {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Let
$$ \bar{C} = 0.5\bar{c}_{L} + 0.5\bar{c}_{H} $$
be average certainty equivalent
- $u(\bar{C})$ is utility if everyone could be given the average certainty equivalent from benchmark economy.
- $$u(\bar{C}) - \mathbb{E}[u(y)] = u(0.5\bar{c}_{L}+0.5\bar{c}_{H}) - 0.5u(\bar{c}_{L}) - 0.5u(\bar{c}_{H})$$ 
is a measure of the **gains from redistribution** when uncertainty is removed via certainty equivalence
:::

## Example 1: A decomposition 

:::{.incremental}
- $u(C^*) - u(\bar{C})$ is likewise a measure of the **gains from insurance** derived from valuing gains in certainty equivalents.
- This gives a decomposition:
$$ W_{1} - W_{0} = \underbrace{u(C^*) - u(\bar{C})}_{\text{insurance}} + \underbrace{u(\bar{C}) - \mathbb{E}[u(y)]}_{\text{redistribution}} $$
- **Exercises**:
    - Calculate the decomposition with log utility
    - Look at how it changes with $\pi$
:::

## Example 1: picturing the decomposition


## Example 2: a dynamic economy

:::{.incremental}
- Assume same type structure, $\tau(i)\in\{L,H}$ for all agents $i$
- But now infinite horizon, $t=0,1,2,...,\infty$
- $\log(y_{it}) = \mu_{\tau(i)} + \varepsilon_{it}$,\ $\varepsilon_{it}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$, $\mu_{L}<\mu_{H}$ 
- Benchmark: no private insurance markets, $c_{it} = y_{it}$.
- $V_{i} = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^\infty u(c_{it})\right]
:::

## Example 2

**Exercises**:

:::{.incremental}
- Derive $V_{\tau}$ for each type in benchmark
- Solve planner's problem
- Derive decomposition
- Analyze decomposition as $\mu_{L}\rightarrow\mu_{H}$, $\sigma^2\rightarrow0$
:::

## Example 3

:::{.incremental}
- same economy as example (2), **except** assume that individuals can insure against $\varepsilon_{it}$, i.e. in the benchmark for all $i$, $t$:
$$ c_{it} = \exp\left(\mu_{\tau(i)} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\right) $$
- What does the decomposition look like in this case?
:::

## Example 4
A harder exercise for you try.

:::{.incremental}
- Assume
$$ y_{it} = \mu + \rho(y_{it-1} - \mu) + \zeta_{it},\ \ \zeta_{it}\sim{N}(0,\sigma^2_{\zeta}) $$
- No borrowing or saving (consume $y_{it}$).

# Application: Storesletten, Telmer & Yaron (2004)

## Overview: @Storesletten2004 {.smaller}

**Main Question**: Can individual earnings risk explain why consumption and income inequality increase with age?

:::{.incremental}
- **Key Finding**: Yes! An overlapping generations model with uninsurable earnings shocks can account for:
  - Both earnings and consumption inequality over the life cycle
  - The fact that consumption inequality increases less than earnings inequality
- **Data Sources**:
  - Earnings: Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), 1969-1992
  - Consumption: Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), 1980-1990
:::

## The Empirical Facts {.smaller}

![Figure 1 from @Storesletten2004: Cross-sectional variance of log earnings and consumption by age](../papers/figures/sty_fig1.png){width=70%}

Three striking patterns in U.S. data:

1. **Both earnings and consumption inequality increase substantially with age** (ages 23-60)
2. **Consumption inequality rises less than earnings inequality**
3. **Both increase approximately linearly** over working years

**Interpretation**: Imperfect risk sharing - something between complete markets and autarky

## Is It Just Predetermined Skills? {.smaller}

![Figure 2 from @Storesletten2004: Inequality by education group](../papers/figures/sty_fig2.png){width=75%}

:::{.incremental}
- If inequality were just about predetermined skills, we'd see flat profiles **within** education groups
- But we see rising inequality **within** each education group!
- This supports the "shocks" story over the "skills" story
- Even controlling for broad skill measures, idiosyncratic risk matters
:::

## The Earnings Process {.smaller}

Log earnings for household $i$ at age $h$:
$$ \log(n_{ih}) = \kappa_h + \alpha_i + z_{ih} + \varepsilon_{ih} $$

:::{.incremental}
- $\kappa_h$: deterministic age profile
- $\alpha_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\alpha)$: **fixed effect** (realized at birth, permanent)
- $z_{ih}$: **persistent shock**: $z_{ih} = \rho z_{i,h-1} + \eta_{ih}$, where $\eta_{ih} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\eta)$
- $\varepsilon_{ih} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\varepsilon)$: **transitory shock** (i.i.d.)
:::

. . .

**Key Estimate**: $\rho \approx 0.999$ (near unit root!)

## Why Near Unit-Root Persistence? {.smaller}

![Figure 3 from @Storesletten2004: Model fit to earnings inequality profile](../papers/figures/sty_fig3.png){width=65%}

:::{.incremental}
- The **linear** shape of the age-variance profile is crucial
- Lower persistence (ρ < 0.95) would generate **concave** profiles
- Near unit-root (ρ ≈ 1) generates the linear pattern we see in data
- This is a robust finding across different specifications
:::

## The Model: Key Features {.smaller}

**Overlapping Generations Economy**:

:::{.incremental}
- Agents live ages 22-100, retire at 65
- Face uninsurable idiosyncratic earnings shocks
- Can save/borrow via a single asset (capital)
- Pay-as-you-go social security system
- **General equilibrium**: aggregate wealth is endogenous
:::

. . .

**Calibration Strategy**:
- Match aggregate wealth/income ratio = 3.1 (for bottom 99%)
- Match earnings process to PSID data
- Check if model matches consumption inequality from CEX

## Main Results {.smaller}

![Figure 4 from @Storesletten2004: Model predictions for consumption inequality](../papers/figures/sty_fig4.png){width=70%}

:::{.incremental}
- **Model matches earnings inequality by construction** (calibration target)
- **Benchmark (no social security)**: 20% too much consumption inequality
- **With social security**: Nearly perfect match!
- Social security's concave replacement rate provides implicit insurance within generations
:::

## The Role of Wealth {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
**Aggregate wealth is crucial for risk sharing**:

- More wealth → more buffer-stock savings → more consumption smoothing
- Model calibrated to match U.S. wealth/income ratio = 3.1

**Experiment**: Reduce wealth/income ratio from 3.1 to 1.5
- Result: Consumption inequality ↑ by 17%
- Would need 36% (vs. 20%) reduction in shock variances to match data
:::

. . .

**Implication**: General equilibrium matters! The amount of self-insurance feasible depends critically on economy-wide wealth accumulation.

## Insurance vs. Redistribution Decomposition {.smaller}

**Key Welfare Question**: Which matters more?

1. **Fixed effects** ($\alpha_i$): Inequality determined at birth
2. **Life-cycle shocks** ($z_{ih}, \varepsilon_{ih}$): Shocks received during working years

. . .

**Results**:

| Type of Risk | Welfare Cost (% of consumption) |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Life-cycle shocks | **27.4%** |
| Fixed effects | **20.2%** |

. . .

**Comparison with Keane & Wolpin (1997)**:
- They found: 90% of lifetime utility variance from fixed effects
- STY (2004): Only 47% from fixed effects

## Policy Implications {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
1. **Life-cycle shocks are important for welfare**
   - Not just predetermined heterogeneity!
   - Buffer-stock savings and precautionary behavior matter

2. **Social security provides valuable insurance**
   - Concave replacement rate redistributes within generations
   - Accounts for ~1.6% of lifetime consumption in welfare gains

3. **Policy design matters**
   - Insurance against life-cycle shocks is as important as addressing inequality at birth
   - Both pre-labor market interventions (education) AND insurance mechanisms (social security, unemployment insurance) are valuable
:::

## Conclusion: What We Learned {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
1. **Empirical**: Earnings shocks are highly persistent (ρ ≈ 1)
   - This is necessary to match linear increase in inequality

2. **Theoretical**: Incomplete markets model can quantitatively account for consumption inequality over life cycle
   - Key ingredients: persistent shocks + calibrated wealth + social security

3. **Normative**: Life-cycle uncertainty is at least as important as fixed heterogeneity
   - Challenges the view that all inequality is predetermined
   - Supports role for insurance mechanisms and financial markets

4. **Methodological**: Age profiles of inequality are informative about risk sharing
   - Rising consumption inequality → imperfect insurance
   - General equilibrium + quantitative calibration crucial
