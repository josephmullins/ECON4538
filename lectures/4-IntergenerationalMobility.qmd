## Overview

:::{.incremental}
- Previous lectures: inequality, welfare, and income processes within individuals over time
- Today: how does economic status persist **across generations**?
- Key questions:
  - How strong is the link between parent and child earnings?
  - Does the U.S. have more or less mobility than other countries?
  - What drives geographic variation in mobility?
- Building up to a theory of **intergenerational inequality**

# Measuring Intergenerational Mobility

## The Intergenerational Elasticity (IGE)

Most common measure: regression of child log income on parent log income

$$y_{\text{child}, i} = \alpha + \beta \cdot y_{\text{parent}, i} + \varepsilon_i$$

:::{.incremental}
- $\beta$ = **intergenerational elasticity** (IGE)
- $\beta = 0$: no relationship (perfect mobility)
- $\beta = 1$: perfect persistence (no mobility)
- Typical estimates: $\beta \approx 0.4$ to 0.6
:::

## Alternative Measure: Rank-Rank Slope

@Chetty2014 popularized rank-based measures:

$$\text{rank}_{\text{child}, i} = \alpha + \beta_r \cdot \text{rank}_{\text{parent}, i} + \varepsilon_i$$

:::{.incremental}
- Ranks: 0-100 percentile in income distribution
- $\beta_r$: how much does parent rank predict child rank?
:::

## Absolute vs Relative Mobility

Two distinct concepts:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Relative mobility**: your rank compared to parents (what we've discussed)
2. **Absolute mobility**: do you earn more than your parents did?
:::

. . .

**Key insight**: Can have high absolute mobility (everyone richer) with low relative mobility (ranks unchanged)

# Early Evidence on U.S. Mobility

## The Solon-Zimmerman Estimates

Early 1990s: @Solon1992 and @Zimmerman1992 used PSID

**Key finding**: $\beta \approx 0.4$

:::{.incremental}
- Much higher than previous estimates (0.2)
- Previous work suffered from:
  - Measurement error
  - Life-cycle bias (measuring parents/children too young)
- **Think**: what does our work on income processes tell us about income over the life-cycle?
:::

## Measurement Error Attenuation

**Classical measurement error** biases IGE toward zero:

$$y_{\text{parent}}^{\text{observed}} = y_{\text{parent}}^{\text{true}} + \nu$$

True model: $y_{\text{child}} = \alpha + \beta \cdot y_{\text{parent}}^{\text{true}} + \varepsilon$

But we estimate: $y_{\text{child}} = \alpha + \beta^* \cdot y_{\text{parent}}^{\text{observed}} + \varepsilon^*$

:::{.incremental}
- Result: $\beta^* < \beta$ (attenuation bias)
- **Solution**: Average parent income over many years
- Or use instrumental variables
:::

## Mazumder's Higher Estimates

@mazumder2005 used Social Security earnings data:

:::{.incremental}
- **Administrative data**: no survey error
- **Long averages**: 16 years of parent earnings
- **Result**: $\beta \approx 0.6$ (!!)
- Substantially less mobility than Solon/Zimmerman
:::

. . .

**Implication**: U.S. mobility lower than previously thought

# Geographic Variation: The Equality of Opportunity Project

## Using Tax Data

@Chetty2014 used **de-identified tax records**:

:::{.incremental}
- 40 million children born 1980-1982
- Linked to parents via tax returns
- Income measured in 2011-2012 (ages 29-32)
- Coverage: ~95% of population
- Geographic detail: Census tract level
:::

. . .

**Unprecedented scale and precision**

## National Findings

Using rank-rank specification:

:::{.incremental}
- National average: $\beta_r = 0.344$
- Absolute mobility: 50% earn more than parents (declining over time)
- Remarkably linear relationship across entire distribution
:::

## National Findings

![Rank-Rank Relationship in U.S. Tax Records [@Chetty2014]](../papers/figures/chetty_fig2.png){width=85%}

National average slope: $\beta_r = 0.341$ — remarkably linear across the distribution



## Geographic Variation is Huge

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: true
using Plots, Random
# Data from Chetty et al. (2014) Table III
# Rank-rank slopes for selected metros (actual values)

metros = ["San Jose", "Salt Lake", "Boston", "Seattle", "Pittsburgh",
          "New York", "Chicago", "Atlanta", "Charlotte", "Milwaukee"]
rank_rank = [0.235, 0.264, 0.322, 0.273, 0.359, 0.330, 0.393, 0.366, 0.397, 0.424]

plot(1:length(metros), rank_rank,
     seriestype=:bar,
     xlabel="",
     ylabel="Rank-Rank Slope",
     title="Mobility Varies Dramatically Across U.S. Cities",
     legend=false,
     xticks=(1:length(metros), metros),
     xrotation=45,
     grid=true,
     left_margin=5Plots.mm,
     bottom_margin=10Plots.mm,
     top_margin=3Plots.mm)
hline!([0.341], linestyle=:dash, linewidth=2, color=:red, label="National average")
```

San Jose looks like Denmark. Charlotte looks like developing country.

## Where is Mobility Highest?

**High-mobility areas** tend to have:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Less residential segregation** (by income and race)
2. **Better K-12 schools** (measured by test scores, spending)
3. **Stronger family structure** (fewer single parents)
4. **More social capital** (civic engagement, church attendance)
5. **Less inequality** (smaller Gini coefficient)
:::

. . .

These are **correlations**, not necessarily causal.

## Key Takeaways

:::{.incremental}
1. U.S. has **lower mobility** than many developed countries ($\beta \approx 0.4-0.6$)
2. Mobility varies **dramatically by geography**
3. Strong correlates: segregation, schools, family structure, inequality
:::

. . .

For policy: 

- **What determines intergenerational mobility**? 
- What policies can level the playing field and are they desirable? 
- More theory and data to come.
