## Overview

:::{.incremental}
- Previous lectures: inequality, welfare, and income processes within individuals over time
- Today: how does economic status persist **across generations**?
- Key questions:
  - How strong is the link between parent and child earnings?
  - Does the U.S. have more or less mobility than other countries?
  - What drives geographic variation in mobility?
- As we'll see, mobility connects income processes to long-run inequality.
:::

# Motivation

## The American Dream

A central tenet of American identity:

> "Each generation should do better than the last, regardless of where they start"

:::{.incremental}
- Does this hold empirically?
- How much does your parent's income determine yours?
- Is the U.S. "the land of opportunity"?
:::

## Why Study Intergenerational Mobility?

:::{.incremental}
1. **Normative**: Many view high mobility as desirable
   - Equal opportunity vs equal outcomes
2. **Positive**: Understanding persistence of inequality
   - Will income disparities persist or fade?
3. **Policy**: Identifying effective interventions
   - Education? Early childhood? Neighborhoods?
4. **Theory**: Testing models of human capital accumulation
:::

## Connection to Income Processes

Recall from Lecture 3:

$$y_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_i \cdot t + p_{it} + e_{it}$$

:::{.incremental}
- $\alpha_i$: permanent individual component
- Where does $\alpha_i$ come from?
- **One answer**: parental resources, investments
- Mobility studies: correlation between parent and child $\alpha$'s
:::

# Measuring Intergenerational Mobility

## The Intergenerational Elasticity (IGE)

Most common measure: regression of child log income on parent log income

$$y_{\text{child}, i} = \alpha + \beta \cdot y_{\text{parent}, i} + \varepsilon_i$$

:::{.incremental}
- $\beta$ = **intergenerational elasticity** (IGE)
- $\beta = 0$: no relationship (perfect mobility)
- $\beta = 1$: perfect persistence (no mobility)
- Typical estimates: $\beta \approx 0.4$ to 0.6
:::

## Alternative Measure: Rank-Rank Slope

@Chetty2014 popularized rank-based measures:

$$\text{rank}_{\text{child}, i} = \alpha + \beta_r \cdot \text{rank}_{\text{parent}, i} + \varepsilon_i$$

:::{.incremental}
- Ranks: 0-100 percentile in income distribution
- $\beta_r$: how much does parent rank predict child rank?
:::


## Empirical Evidence: U.S. Data

![Rank-Rank Relationship in U.S. Tax Records [@Chetty2014]](../papers/figures/chetty_fig2.png){width=85%}

National average slope: $\beta_r = 0.341$ — remarkably linear across the distribution

## Rank-Rank: Interpretation

If $\beta_r = 0.3$:

:::{.incremental}
- Child of 25th percentile parent expects to reach 33rd percentile
- Child of 75th percentile parent expects to reach 58th percentile
- Movement toward middle: **mean reversion**
- But substantial persistence remains
:::

## Absolute vs Relative Mobility

Two distinct concepts:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Relative mobility**: your rank compared to parents (what we've discussed)
2. **Absolute mobility**: do you earn more than your parents did?
:::

. . .

**Key insight**: Can have high absolute mobility (everyone richer) with low relative mobility (ranks unchanged)

# Early Evidence on U.S. Mobility

## The Solon-Zimmerman Estimates

Early 1990s: @Solon1992 and @Zimmerman1992 used PSID

**Key finding**: $\beta \approx 0.4$

:::{.incremental}
- Much higher than previous estimates (0.2)
- Previous work suffered from:
  - Measurement error
  - Life-cycle bias (measuring parents/children too young)
:::

## Measurement Error Attenuation

**Classical measurement error** biases IGE toward zero:

$$y_{\text{parent}}^{\text{observed}} = y_{\text{parent}}^{\text{true}} + \nu$$

True model: $y_{\text{child}} = \alpha + \beta \cdot y_{\text{parent}}^{\text{true}} + \varepsilon$

But we estimate: $y_{\text{child}} = \alpha + \beta^* \cdot y_{\text{parent}}^{\text{observed}} + \varepsilon^*$

:::{.incremental}
- Result: $\beta^* < \beta$ (attenuation bias)
- **Solution**: Average parent income over many years
- Or use instrumental variables
:::

## Mazumder's Higher Estimates

@mazumder2005 used Social Security earnings data:

:::{.incremental}
- **Administrative data**: no survey error
- **Long averages**: 16 years of parent earnings
- **Result**: $\beta \approx 0.6$ (!!)
- Substantially less mobility than Solon/Zimmerman
:::

. . .

**Implication**: U.S. mobility lower than previously thought

# Geographic Variation: The Equality of Opportunity Project

## Using Tax Data

@Chetty2014 used **de-identified tax records**:

:::{.incremental}
- 40 million children born 1980-1982
- Linked to parents via tax returns
- Income measured in 2011-2012 (ages 29-32)
- Coverage: ~95% of population
- Geographic detail: Census tract level
:::

. . .

**Unprecedented scale and precision**

## National Findings

Using rank-rank specification:

:::{.incremental}
- National average: $\beta_r = 0.344$
- Interpretation: child at 25th percentile parent rank � expected rank of 33.6
- Absolute mobility: 50% earn more than parents (declining over time)
- Remarkably linear relationship across entire distribution

San Jose looks like Denmark. Charlotte looks like developing country.

## Where is Mobility Highest?

**High-mobility areas** tend to have:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Less residential segregation** (by income and race)
2. **Better K-12 schools** (measured by test scores, spending)
3. **Stronger family structure** (fewer single parents)
4. **More social capital** (civic engagement, church attendance)
5. **Less inequality** (smaller Gini coefficient)
:::

. . .

These are **correlations**, not necessarily causal.

## Correlates of Upward Mobility {.smaller}

![Key Predictors of Intergenerational Mobility [@Chetty2014]](../papers/figures/chetty_fig8_p53.png){width=85%}

## Segregation and Mobility

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: true

# Stylized relationship between segregation and mobility
Random.seed!(456)
n_cities = 50
segregation = rand(n_cities) .* 0.5 .+ 0.2
mobility = 0.55 .- 0.8 .* segregation .+ randn(n_cities) .* 0.03

        markersize=6,
        alpha=0.6,
        xlabel="Residential Segregation Index",
        ylabel="Rank-Rank Slope",

      linestyle=:dash)

annotate!(0.35, 0.5, text("More segregation �\nLess mobility", 10, :left))
```

Correlation: -0.67

## School Quality Matters

Test scores predict mobility even controlling for segregation:

:::{.incremental}
- 1 SD higher test scores � 0.02 higher mobility
- School spending shows weaker relationship
- Quality matters more than spending per se
- But: sorting makes causality difficult
:::

. . .

**Question**: How would you test if this is causal?

## Family Structure

Areas with more single mothers have lower mobility:

:::{.incremental}
- 1 SD more single mothers � 0.03 lower mobility
- Holds even for children of married parents
- Suggests **neighborhood peer effects**
- Or: family structure proxies for other factors
:::

## Moving to Opportunity

Can changing neighborhoods improve outcomes?

**Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment** [@Chetty2016]:

:::{.incremental}
- Randomized housing vouchers to move to lower-poverty areas
- Children who moved **before age 13**: large gains
  - 30% increase in earnings
  - Higher college attendance
- Children who moved **after age 13**: no gains
- Suggests **critical period** for neighborhood effects
:::

## The Role of Age

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: true

# Stylized age-at-move effects from Chetty MTO reanalysis
ages = 0:18
# Effect declines linearly from age 0 to 13, then flat
effects = max.(0, 1 .- (ages ./ 13))

plot(ages, effects .* 30,
     linewidth=3,
     xlabel="Age at Move to Better Neighborhood",
     ylabel="Effect on Later Earnings (%)",
     title="Childhood Exposure Effects (MTO)",
     legend=false,
     grid=true,
     marker=:circle,
     markersize=4)
annotate!(15, 15, text("Critical period:\nages 0-13", 10, :left))
```

**Implication**: Early interventions may be more effective

## Race and Mobility

Large racial disparities:

:::{.incremental}
- Black children from high-income families have **lower upward mobility**
- Black children from low-income families have **similar or lower upward mobility**
- Disparities largest for men
- Persist even within same neighborhoods
- Suggests factors beyond neighborhood matter (discrimination, networks)
:::

## The Puzzle of Declining Mobility

Is mobility declining over time?

:::{.incremental}
- **Relative mobility** (rank-rank): roughly constant since 1980s
- **Absolute mobility**: sharply declining
  - 90% of 1940 cohort earned more than parents
  - Only 50% of 1980 cohort earned more than parents
- Due to: slower GDP growth + rising inequality
:::

## Exercise: Thinking About Causes

Consider the five correlates:

1. Segregation
2. Schools
3. Family structure
4. Social capital
5. Inequality

**Questions**:

a) Which do you think is most important causally?
b) How would you test your hypothesis?
c) What policy interventions would you propose?
d) Are these factors related to each other?

# Connections to Theory

## Linking to Becker-Tomes Model

Simple framework [@Becker1979]:

$$y_{\text{child}} = h(I_{\text{parent}}, \theta, \varepsilon)$$

:::{.incremental}
- $I$: parental investments (money, time)
- $\theta$: child ability/endowment
- $\varepsilon$: luck/environment
- Parents choose $I$ to maximize child outcomes
- Predicts: IGE depends on returns to investment
:::

## What Determines the IGE?

In Becker-Tomes framework:

$$\beta = \frac{\text{var}(I) \cdot \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial I}\right)^2 + \text{cov}(\theta, y_{\text{parent}})}{\text{var}(y_{\text{parent}})}$$

:::{.incremental}
- Higher return to investment $\rightarrow$ higher IGE
- More inequality in investments $\rightarrow$ higher IGE
- More inequality in endowments $\rightarrow$ potentially lower IGE
- Connection to income processes: investments affect $\alpha_i$
:::

## Credit Constraints

If poor families are **credit constrained**:

:::{.incremental}
- Cannot invest optimally in children
- Creates persistence: poor � low investment � poor
- Rich families invest more efficiently
- **Implication**: IGE could be lowered by:
  - Education subsidies
  - Early childhood programs
  - Reducing borrowing constraints
:::

. . .

We'll explore these policies in later lectures.

## The Role of Heritability

Genetic vs environmental transmission:

:::{.incremental}
- **Genetic**: ability, personality traits
- **Environmental**: investments, culture, neighborhoods
- **Evidence**: adoption studies show both matter
- But: gene-environment interactions complicate story
- Policy can't change genes, but can change returns to ability
:::

## Connecting to Income Processes

Recall from Lecture 3:

$$y_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_i \cdot t + p_{it} + e_{it}$$

Intergenerational transmission:

:::{.incremental}
- Child's $\alpha_i$ correlated with parent's $\alpha_i$
- Child's $\beta_i$ (growth rate) also correlated with parent income
- Permanent shocks $p_{it}$ may be correlated across generations
- Mobility studies: focus on $\alpha$ correlation
:::

# Policy Implications

## What Policies Can Increase Mobility?

Based on evidence:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Early childhood education** (critical period effects)
2. **School quality improvements** (test scores matter)
3. **Desegregation policies** (exposure effects)
4. **Housing vouchers** (MTO results)
5. **Income support** (reduce credit constraints)
:::

. . .

**But**: need causal evidence on each!

## The Equity-Efficiency Tradeoff?

Traditional view: redistribution reduces efficiency

**But**: if mobility is low due to market failures:

:::{.incremental}
- Credit constraints � underinvestment in poor children
- This is **inefficient** (high-return investments not made)
- Policies that increase mobility may **increase efficiency**
- Depends on whether low mobility reflects optimal responses or constraints
:::

## The Role of Place-Based Policies

Evidence suggests **where you grow up matters**:

:::{.incremental}
- Move to better neighborhood � better outcomes
- But: neighborhood characteristics are endogenous
- **Place-based policies**:
  - Promise zones, empowerment zones
  - School improvements
  - Infrastructure investments
- Key question: cheaper to move people or improve places?
:::

## Universal vs Targeted Programs

Two approaches:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Universal**: benefits for all children (e.g., public schools)
   - Pros: less stigma, political support
   - Cons: expensive, some waste
2. **Targeted**: focus on disadvantaged (e.g., Head Start)
   - Pros: cost-effective, high returns
   - Cons: potential stigma, targeting challenges
:::

. . .

**What do you think is better?**

# Measurement and Data Challenges

## The Age-30 Problem

Chetty et al. measure children at ages 29-32:

:::{.incremental}
- Problem: haven't reached peak earnings yet
- May understate mobility if poor children have steeper profiles
- But: measuring later means waiting longer!
- @mazumder2018 suggests IGE keeps rising when measured at older ages
:::

## Selection and Migration

Who stays in their birth location?

:::{.incremental}
- Successful children may **leave** low-mobility areas
- Makes area look worse than it is
- Unsuccessful children may **return** to low-cost areas
- Chetty et al. can track movers
- But: more complex to interpret
:::

## Recent Extensions

@Chetty2020 study racial disparities:

:::{.incremental}
- Black-white gaps persist even for same-income families
- Gaps larger for men than women
- Neighborhood-level variation in gaps
- Intergenerational wealth matters beyond income
:::

## Data Limitations

Even with tax data:

:::{.incremental}
- Cannot observe: wealth, consumption, life satisfaction
- Top-coding issues at very high incomes
- Informal sector earnings not captured
- Intergenerational wealth transmission understudied
:::

# Summary

## Key Takeaways

:::{.incremental}
1. U.S. has **lower mobility** than many developed countries ($\beta \approx 0.4-0.6$)
2. Mobility varies **dramatically by geography**
3. Strong correlates: segregation, schools, family structure, inequality
:::

## Why This Matters

:::{.incremental}
- **Normative**: Equal opportunity is stated social goal
- **Positive**: Low mobility � persistent inequality
- **Policy**: Identifies high-return interventions
- **Connection**: Links income processes (Lecture 3) to skills (Lecture 5)
:::

## Open Questions

Important areas for future research:

:::{.incremental}
1. What are the **causal mechanisms** behind geographic variation?
2. Why has **absolute mobility** declined so much?
3. What explains persistent **racial disparities** in mobility?
4. How does **wealth** (not just income) transmit across generations?
5. What are optimal policies given mobility patterns?
6. How do **different margins** (education, occupation, marriage) contribute?
:::

## For Next Lecture

We'll study **skills and inequality**:

:::{.incremental}
- What are "skills" and how do we measure them?
- Technology of skill formation (Cunha & Heckman)
- Dynamic complementarity and critical periods
- Connection to mobility: skills as the mechanism
- Why early investments have highest returns
