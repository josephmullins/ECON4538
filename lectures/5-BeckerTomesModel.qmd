## Overview

:::{.incremental}
- We have learned that income inequality tends to persist across generations 
- Today: **theory** of intergenerational transmission
- The Becker-Tomes model [@Becker1979; @Becker1986] is a workhorse framework
- We'll study some stylized versions
- Key questions:
  - Why do earnings regress to the mean?
  - How do parents affect children's outcomes?
  - What determines the speed of mobility?
- Building a **unified framework** for inequality and mobility
:::

# The Becker-Tomes Framework

## Basic Setup {.smaller}

There are 5 basic ingredients in the model:


:::{.incremental}
1. In each period $t$, one generation of adults raises the next generation for $t+1$ (an "OLG" framework)
2. Care only about consumption, with an altruistic weight $\beta$ on future generations
3. Can transfer wealth through: 
    1. *Financial assets* $A_{t}$, with rate of return $r$; or 
    2. *Human capital*, $H_{t}$, with price $w$ (the wage)
4. A production function converts investments $X_{t}$ into human capital $H_{t+1}$
5. An ability endowment, $z_{t}$, evolves exogenously.
:::

## A Simple Version {.smaller}

Here is a simple version that captures important forces:

:::{.incremental}
- Ability is mean-reverting:
$$ z_{t+1} = \rho z_{t} + \eta_{t+1},\ \rho \in(0,1) $$
- Human capital production:
$$ H_{t+1} = \exp(\mu + z_{t})X_{t}^{\delta} $$
where $X_{t}$ has price $\psi$
- Budget constraint:
$$ C_{t} + \frac{A_{t+1}}{1+r} + \psi X_{t} \leq A_{t} + wH_{t} $$
:::

## A recursive formulation

Let $\Omega_{t} = A_{t} + wH_{t}$ be total wealth in period $t$:

$$ V(\Omega_{t},z_{t}) = \max_{C_{t},X_{t},A_{t+1}}\left\{ u(C_{t}) + \beta \mathbb{E}[V(\Omega_{t+1},z_{t+1})] \right\} $$

subject to:

$$ 
\begin{eqnarray}
C_{t} + \psi X_{t} + \frac{A_{t+1}}{1+r} \leq \Omega_{t} \\
\Omega_{t+1} = A_{t+1} + wH_{t+1} \\
z_{t+1} = \rho z_{t} + \eta_{t+1} \\
H_{t+1} = \exp(\mu+z_{t})X_{t}^{\delta}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

. . .

**Note:** no constraints on borrowing (for now)

## Model Solution

:::{.incremental}
- This is quite a simple model, but we can learn some interesting and useful things from it
- We'll show that investment *does not* depend on wealth or income
- We'll derive the IGE in terms of model primitives
- We'll look at the effect of innovations in $z_{t}$ in the long-run
:::


## Result 1: Investment does not depend on Income

Steps:

1. Take FOC wrt $X_{t}$ and $A_{t+1}$
2. Show that:
$$ X_{t} = \left(\frac{\delta w \exp(\mu+z_{t})}{(1+r)\psi}\right)^{1/(1-\delta)} $$
3. Analyze. Notice no direct effect of income.

## Result 2: The IGE {.smaller}

Steps:

1. Show that
$$\log(H_{t}) = c + \frac{1}{1-\delta}z_{t-1}$$
where $c$ is a constant.
2. Show that
$$ \log(H_{t+1}) = \rho\log(H_{t}) + \frac{1}{1-\delta}\eta_{t} + b $$
where $b$ is a constant.
3. Show that the IGE is equal to $\rho$.

## Result 3: The Long-Run Effects of Good Fortune

What is the long-run effect of an increase in $z$?

:::{.incremental}
- To do this, let's assume that $\beta(1+r) = 1$ for simplicity
- We'll take a derivative around the deterministic steady state
- Assume $u(\cdot) = \log(\cdot)$.
:::

## Result 3: The Long-Run Effects of Good Fortune {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
1. Show that in general:
$$ u'(C_{t}) = \beta(1+r)\mathbb{E}u'(C_{t+1}) $$
2. Under our assumptions at steady state: 
$$C_{t}=C_{t+1}=\bar{C}$$
3. Define $Z_{t}=\exp(\mu+z_{t})$ and iterate the budget constraint:
$$ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(1+r)^{t}} \bar{C} = \Omega_{0} + \sum_{t=0}\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}\max_{X_{t}}\left[wZ_{t}X^{\delta}_{t}/(1+r) - \psi X_{t}\right] $$
4. Show that
$$ \max_{X_{t}}\left[wZ_{t}X^{\delta}_{t}/(1+r) - \psi X_{t}\right] = \left(\frac{Z_{t}w}{(1+r)}\right)^{\delta/(1-\delta)}\psi^{-1/(1-\delta)}\left(\delta^{\delta/(1-\delta)} - \delta^{1/(1-\delta)}\right)$$
:::

## Result 3: The Long-Run Effects of Good Fortune {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
5. Hence:
$$ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1+r)^{t}}\bar{C} = \Omega_{0} + B\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\exp(z_{t})^{\delta/(1-\delta)} \left(= \Omega_{0}+B \text{ at long-run steady state}\right)$$ 
where $B$ collects constants in previous expression.
6. Consider a one-time, small increase in $z_{0}$, s.t. $z_{t} = \rho^{t}z_{0}$:
$$ \frac{d\bar{C}}{dz_{0}}\Big\vert_{z_{0}=0} = \frac{r}{1+r} \frac{\delta}{1-\delta} B\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\frac{\rho^{t}}{(1+r)^{t}} = \frac{\delta}{1-\delta}\times B\times \frac{r}{1+r-\rho}$$
7. So
$$ \frac{d\log(\bar{C})}{dz_{0}}\Big\vert_{z_{0}=0} = \text{Future earnings share of wealth} \times\frac{\delta}{1-\delta}\times \frac{1+r}{1+r-\rho}  $$
8. Interpret!

## Connecting to IGE Estimation

Recall from last lecture we estimated:

$$y_{\text{child}} = \alpha + \beta \cdot y_{\text{parent}} + \varepsilon$$

:::{.incremental}
- In this model: $\beta = \rho$ (ability persistence)
- Independent of technology parameter $\delta$
- Independent of prices $w$, $\psi$, $r$
- **Policy invariant**: transfers don't change IGE
:::

. . .

**Think**: Is this consistent with geographic variation in mobility we saw?

## Takeaways so far

:::{.incremental}
- Investment does not depend on income (when borrowing is unconstrained)
- Human capital differences fade away, but consumption effects last forever
- Rich households use wealth bequests to maintain dynasties as human capital fades away
- IGE determined by ability persistence ($\rho$) and human capital production ($\delta$)
- But is this realistic? What about credit constraints?

# A Two-Period Model

## Why Start with Two Periods?

:::{.incremental}
- Simplify exposition of some key points
- Two-period version captures key forces
- Lessons generalize
:::

## Two-Period Setup {.smaller}

Parent's problem in period 1:

$$\max_{C_1, C_2, X} u(C_1) + \beta u(C_2)$$

subject to:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
C_1 + \psi X + \frac{A'}{1+r} &\leq& \Omega \\
C_2 &=& A' + w z X^{\delta}
\end{eqnarray}
$$

:::{.incremental}
- $\Omega = wH + A$: total lifetime wealth
- $A'$: bequests (can be negative = borrowing)
:::

## Combining Budget Constraints

Combining the two constraints:

$$C_1 + \frac{1}{1+r} C_2 \leq \Omega + \frac{w z X^{\delta}}{1+r} - \psi X$$

:::{.incremental}
- Left side: present value of consumption
- Right side: wealth plus net human capital investment
- Net investment: returns $\frac{w z X^{\delta}}{1+r}$ but costs $\psi X$
:::

## First-Order Conditions

Euler equation:

$$u'(C_1) = \beta(1+r) u'(C_2)$$

. . .

FOC with respect to $X$:

$$\psi = \frac{\delta w z X^{\delta-1}}{1+r}$$

. . .

Same result as before on optimal $X$.

## Investment Does Not Depend on Income (again)

Just as before, we get:
$$X^* = \left( \frac{\delta w z}{\psi(1+r)} \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\delta}}$$

## With Log Utility {.smaller}

If $u(C) = \log(C)$, we can solve explicitly:

From Euler equation:
$$\frac{C_2}{C_1} = \beta(1+r)$$

Therefore:
$$(1+\beta)C_1 = \Omega + \frac{w z X^{*\delta}}{1+r} - \psi X^{*}$$

Where
$$X^* = \left( \frac{\delta w z}{\psi(1+r)} \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\delta}}$$

## Interpretation

What does this mean economically?

:::{.incremental}
- Parents optimize to equate marginal returns across uses
- Rich and poor parents with same $z$ invest the same in children
- Differences in income absorbed by $C_1$, $C_2$, and $A$
- **Crucial assumption**: can borrow against future returns to H.C. investment
:::

. . .

**Question**: Is this realistic? What if parents can't borrow?

# Efficiency and the Social Planner

## Is the Market Outcome Efficient? {.smaller}

Consider a social planner who maximizes weighted welfare:

$$\max_{\{C_{i1}, C_{i2}, X_i\}_{i\in[0,1]}} \int \left(\mu_{i1} u(C_{i1}) + \mu_{i2} u(C_{i2})\right)di$$

subject to resource constraint:

$$\int C_{i1} di + \frac{1}{1+r} \int C_{i2} di \leq \int \Omega_i di + \frac{w}{1+r} \int z_i X_i^{\delta} di - \psi \int X_i di$$

. . .

**Key question**: Does the planner's solution coincide with the market?

## Planner's First-Order Conditions {.smaller}

The planner's FOCs are:

$$\frac{u'(C_{i1})}{u'(C_{i2})} = \frac{\mu_{i2}}{\mu_{i1}}, \quad \frac{\delta w z_i X_i^{\delta-1}}{1+r} = \psi$$

Compare to market FOCs:

$$\frac{u'(C_{i1})}{u'(C_{i2})} = \beta(1+r), \quad \frac{\delta w z_{i} X_{i}^{\delta-1}}{1+r} = \psi$$

:::{.incremental}
- Investment is **identical**: $X_i^* = X_i^{planner}$
- Only difference: consumption allocation via weights $\mu_{i1}, \mu_{i2}$
- Market outcome is **efficient** for some choice of weights
:::

## Efficiency Interpretation

What does this mean?

:::{.incremental}
- The market outcome is **Pareto efficient**
- "can't make anyone better off without making someone worse off"
- Relative to Laissez-Faire economy, Planner can redistribute but that's it
:::

. . .

**But**: This relies critically on perfect credit markets!

# Incomplete Markets

## Can Parents Borrow?

:::{.incremental}
- Is it really plausible that parents can borrow against returns on their investment in children?
  - And make the children pay for it?
- No!!
- All kinds of moral hazard problems + legal issues
- Also implied no role for income in shaping human capital
:::

## A more realistic setup

$$\max_{C_1, C_2, X} u(C_1) + \beta u(C_2)$$

subject to:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
C_1 + \psi X + \frac{A'}{1+r} &\leq& \Omega \\
C_2 &=& A' + w z X^{\delta} \\
A' &\geq& 0
\end{eqnarray}
$$

. . . 

Positive bequests only!

## Inefficient investment

:::{.incremental}
- This now implies:
$$ \frac{\delta w z X^{\delta - 1}}{1+r} \geq \psi $$
with equality iff $A'\geq 0$ and strict inequality if $A=0$.
- Equilibriums is **inefficient**. 
- Introduces a role for policy to improve market outcomes
- Make everyone better off (Pareto improvement)
:::

## When do constraints bind?

:::{.incremental}
- Solve for $X^*$ when $A=0$:
$$ \max_{X} u(\Omega - \psi X) + \beta u(wzX^{\delta}) $$
- With log utility:
$$ X^* = \frac{1}{\psi}\frac{\beta\delta}{1+\beta\delta} \Omega $$
- Note that $X^{*}$ now depends on $\Omega$ 
:::

## When Do Constraints Bind?

The borrowing constraint binds if:

$$\frac{1}{\psi}\frac{\beta \delta }{1 + \beta \delta} \Omega \leq \left( \frac{\delta w z}{\psi(1+r)} \right)^{\frac{1}{1-\delta}}$$

:::{.incremental}
- More likely to bind when $\Omega$ is low (poor families)
- More likely to bind when $z$ is high (high returns to investment)
- Creates a **region** where investment increases with income

# Unconstrained investment for each z

. . .

Note: High-$z$ children benefit more from relaxing constraints (steeper slope when binding)

## Policy Implications

:::{.incremental}
- Note that we would like to target transfers based on $z$
- But $z$ is *unobservable*
- An alternative is income-targeted transfers
  - e.g. progressive taxation
- Can also try direct public investment (e.g. education, early childhood programs)
- The gains to society depend on the joint distribution of $(\Omega,z)$
- What does the evidence say?
:::

## What Does the Evidence Say?

In coming lectures we'll see:

:::{.incremental}
- Evidence suggests borrowing constraints **do bind** for many families
- Returns to college are high, but many don't attend
- Educational interventions (especially early childhood) show high returns
- Suggests scope for welfare-improving policy
