## Overview

:::{.incremental}
- Previous lecture: geographic variation in mobility
- Today: **theory** of intergenerational transmission
- The Becker-Tomes model [@Becker1979; @Becker1986]
- Key questions:
  - Why do earnings regress to the mean?
  - How do parents affect children's outcomes?
  - What determines the speed of mobility?
- Building a **unified framework** for inequality and mobility
:::

# The Basic Framework

## Three Channels of Transmission

Parents affect children through:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Endowments** (genes and culture): $E_t$
   - IQ, personality, work ethic, cultural capital
2. **Human capital investments**: $x_t$
   - Education, training, health, early childhood
3. **Financial transfers**: bequests and gifts
   - Assets, property, cash transfers
:::

. . .

Each channel has different properties for transmission across generations.

## Endowment Transmission

Endowments follow a **Markov process**:

$$E_t = \alpha + h E_{t-1} + v_t$$

:::{.incremental}
- $h$ = **inheritability** parameter (how much is passed on)
- $0 < h < 1$: endowments regress to the mean
- $\alpha$ = social endowment (common to all)
- $v_t$ = random luck in endowment transmission
:::

. . .

**Think**: What does $h < 1$ imply for children of high-ability parents?

## Why Does h < 1?

:::{.incremental}
- **Genetics**: Mendel's laws → regression to the mean
  - Child gets random draw from parents' genes
  - Extreme traits don't fully transmit
- **Culture**: imperfect transmission of values/habits
  - Peer effects, media, broader environment matter
- **Empirical evidence**: $h \approx 0.3$ to $0.6$ for earnings-relevant traits
:::

. . .

This **automatic regression** is key to understanding mobility.

## Earnings Generation

Adult earnings depend on human capital and luck:

$$Y_t = H_t + \varepsilon_t$$

where human capital is produced by:

$$H_t = \psi(x_{t-1}, s_{t-1}, E_t)$$

:::{.incremental}
- $x_{t-1}$ = parental investments
- $s_{t-1}$ = public investments (schools, etc.)
- $E_t$ = endowments
- $\psi$ is increasing in all three inputs
:::

## Complementarity

**Key assumption**: endowments and investments are **complements**

$$\frac{\partial^2 H_t}{\partial x_{t-1} \partial E_t} > 0$$

:::{.incremental}
- Higher ability → higher return to education
- Better endowed children get more from investments
- Reinforces initial advantages
- Creates skewness in earnings distribution
:::

. . .

**Question**: Does this match your intuition about returns to education?

# Perfect Capital Markets

## The Wealth-Maximizing Case

Suppose parents can **borrow freely** against children's future earnings.

Then they solve:
$$\max_{x_{t-1}} \quad H_t(x_{t-1}, E_t) - (1+r) x_{t-1}$$

First-order condition:
$$\frac{\partial H_t}{\partial x_{t-1}} = 1 + r$$

. . .

**Implication**: Marginal return on human capital = interest rate for ALL families.

## Investment with Perfect Markets

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: true

using Plots

# Marginal product curves for different endowments
x = 0:0.1:10
mp_low(x) = 10 * exp(-0.3 * x)     # Low endowment
mp_high(x) = 15 * exp(-0.25 * x)   # High endowment

r = 3.0  # Interest rate

plot(x, mp_low.(x),
     label="MP(x | E = low)",
     xlabel="Investment in child (x)",
     ylabel="Marginal product",
     title="Optimal Investment with Perfect Capital Markets",
     linewidth=2,
     legend=:topright,
     grid=true,
     left_margin=5Plots.mm,
     bottom_margin=5Plots.mm)
plot!(x, mp_high.(x), label="MP(x | E = high)", linewidth=2)
hline!([r], label="Interest rate (r)", linestyle=:dash, linewidth=2, color=:red)
```

Higher endowment → higher optimal investment (even at same r).

## Earnings with Perfect Markets

Substitute optimal $x^*$ into earnings:

$$Y_t = H_t(x^*(E_t), E_t) + \varepsilon_t = \phi(E_t, r) + \varepsilon_t$$

Replace $E_t$ using the Markov process:

$$Y_t = c_t + h \cdot Y_{t-1} + \text{error terms}$$

:::{.incremental}
- **Key result**: earnings regress at rate $1-h$
- Speed of regression = inheritability of endowments
- No direct effect of parents' income (perfect credit markets!)
:::

## Consumption and Bequests

With perfect markets, parents choose bequests to satisfy:

$$u'(Z_t) = \delta (1+r) u'(Z_{t+1})$$

:::{.incremental}
- If $\delta(1+r) = 1$: consumption growth = 0
- Consumption does **not** regress to mean!
- Parents use bequests to offset earnings regression
- Rich parents leave large bequests to maintain consumption
:::

. . .

**Surprising**: Perfect mobility in earnings, but dynasties persist in consumption.

# Capital Market Constraints

## The Realistic Case

Most families **cannot** borrow against children's future earnings.

:::{.incremental}
- Human capital is poor collateral
- Moral hazard: children can shirk
- Legal restrictions: can't obligate children for parents' debt
:::

. . .

**Implication**: Parents must self-finance investments in children.

Now parents' **income matters** for investments!

## Constrained Optimization

Parents without assets must trade off:

- Own consumption $Z_t$
- Investment in children $x_{t-1}$

This means:
$$\frac{\partial H_t}{\partial x_{t-1}} > 1 + r$$

. . .

Marginal return on human capital **exceeds** interest rate for poor families.

**Why?** Reducing $x$ raises marginal utility of parents' consumption.

## Investment with Capital Constraints

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: true

using Plots

x = 0:0.1:10
mp(x) = 12 * exp(-0.3 * x)

# Supply curves for different income levels
r = 3.0
mc_poor(x) = 3 + 0.8 * x      # Steep: high shadow cost of funds
mc_middle(x) = 3 + 0.3 * x    # Moderate
mc_rich(x) = fill(r, length(x))  # Flat at r

plot(x, mp.(x),
     label="Marginal product",
     xlabel="Investment in child (x)",
     ylabel="Marginal return / cost",
     title="Investment Under Capital Constraints",
     linewidth=2.5,
     legend=:right,
     grid=true,
     left_margin=5Plots.mm,
     bottom_margin=5Plots.mm,
     ylim=(0, 15))
plot!(x, mc_poor.(x), label="MC (poor family)", linewidth=2, linestyle=:dash)
plot!(x, mc_middle.(x), label="MC (middle family)", linewidth=2, linestyle=:dash)
plot!(x, mc_rich.(x), label="MC (rich family)", linewidth=2, linestyle=:dash)

# Mark equilibria
x_poor = 3.5
x_middle = 6.0
x_rich = 8.5
scatter!([x_poor], [mp(x_poor)], label="", markersize=6, color=:blue)
scatter!([x_middle], [mp(x_middle)], label="", markersize=6, color=:orange)
scatter!([x_rich], [mp(x_rich)], label="", markersize=6, color=:green)
```

Poorer families invest less due to higher marginal cost of funds.

## Earnings Regression with Constraints

Now earnings depend on both endowments AND parents' income:

$$Y_t = \phi(E_t, Y_{t-1}, s_{t-1})$$

:::{.incremental}
- $\frac{\partial Y_t}{\partial Y_{t-1}} = \beta^* > 0$ (income effect)
- Richer parents invest more in children
- Creates **additional persistence** beyond $h$
- Two-generation regression equation:
:::

$$Y_t \approx c_t + (\beta^* + h) Y_{t-1} - \beta^* h \cdot Y_{t-2} + \text{errors}$$

## Three-Generation Test

The model predicts:

- **Positive** coefficient on parents' earnings: $\beta^* + h$
- **Negative** coefficient on grandparents' earnings: $-\beta^* h$

:::{.incremental}
- Grandparents matter through their effect on parents
- But holding parents' earnings fixed, rich grandparents ↔ rich parents ↔ **lower** investments needed
- This negative coefficient is **testable**!
- Evidence (limited): Wahl (1985) finds negative coefficient
:::

## Efficiency Loss from Constraints

Capital constraints cause **inefficiency**:

:::{.incremental}
- Marginal return is **higher** in poor families
- But they invest **less**
- Redistributing investment from rich → poor would raise total output
- **Equity and efficiency** both favor helping poor families
- Justifies subsidies to education for disadvantaged children
:::

. . .

**Policy implication**: Progressive education funding can be efficiency-enhancing.

# Extensions and Implications

## Public Investments

How do public expenditures $s_t$ affect the system?

:::{.incremental}
- If perfect substitutes for $x_t$: partial crowd-out
  - Rich families reduce $x_t$ dollar-for-dollar
  - Poor families reduce less (still constrained)
- If complements (e.g., subsidize tuition → raises return to parental time):
  - Can increase total investment
  - Substitution effect works against redistribution effect
:::

. . .

**Evidence**: Many programs show weak effects due to family offsetting behavior.

## Fertility

Allow number of children $n_t$ to vary:

$$U_t = u(Z_t) + \alpha(n_t) n_t U_{t+1}$$

with $\alpha'(n_t) < 0$ (diminishing marginal utility of children).

:::{.incremental}
- Richer families have more children
- This **dilutes** bequests per child
- Induces regression in wealth per child
- Helps explain why dynasties don't persist forever
:::

## Marriage

**Assortative mating**: tendency to marry someone similar.

:::{.incremental}
- Positive correlation in spouses' endowments
- But **imperfect**: $\text{corr}(E_{\text{mother}}, E_{\text{father}}) < 1$
- Child's endowment = average of parents
- Marriage causes additional regression to mean
- **Empirically**: education correlation ≈ 0.6, earnings ≈ 0.3
:::

. . .

**Combined effect**: fertility + marriage ensure consumption/wealth regress over time.

## Discrimination

Discrimination affects both the intercept and returns:

$$Y_t = \phi(E_t, Y_{t-1}) - D_t$$

:::{.incremental}
- $D_t$ = earnings loss from discrimination
- Lower earnings → tighter capital constraints
- **Prediction**: faster upward mobility among discriminated groups
  - Their marginal returns are higher
  - When discrimination reduces, they catch up faster
- **Evidence**: Black families show faster regression (maybe)
:::

# Empirical Implications

## Predicted Regression Coefficients

The model predicts:

| Variable | Coefficient | Typical value |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Father → son earnings | $\beta^* + h$ | 0.2 - 0.4 |
| Father → son (rich families) | $h$ | 0.3 - 0.5 |
| Grandfather → grandson | $-\beta^* h$ | Negative, small |
| Father → son wealth | Higher (0.5 - 0.7) | |

:::{.incremental}
- Earnings regress faster than wealth
- Most advantages disappear in 3 generations
- But family background still matters significantly
:::

## The "Shirtsleeves to Shirtsleeves" Result

"From shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations."

:::{.incremental}
- If $b = 0.4$: parent earning 2× mean → child earns 1.4× → grandchild earns 1.16×
- After 3 generations: essentially at the mean
- **Rapid** intergenerational mobility in earnings
- But this is **conditional** on no discrimination, equal opportunity
:::

. . .

**Key insight**: Even modest regression rates wipe out advantages quickly.

## Consumption vs. Earnings Mobility

The model distinguishes:

- **Earnings**: regress due to endowments ($h < 1$) and capital constraints
- **Consumption**: buffered by bequests in rich families

:::{.incremental}
- Perfect markets → consumption doesn't regress (dynasties)
- Imperfect markets → consumption regresses faster in poor families
- Fertility/marriage → consumption regresses even in rich families
- **Empirically**: wealth regresses slower than earnings
:::

## Policy Implications

From the Becker-Tomes framework:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Education subsidies**: Address capital constraints, raise efficiency
2. **Progressive taxation**: May increase OR decrease long-run inequality
   - Reduces bequests → more regression
   - But also reduces investment incentives
3. **Early childhood programs**: High returns if:
   - Target capital-constrained families
   - Truly complement (not substitute) family investments
4. **Meritocracy** requires more than talent
   - Need to overcome capital constraints
   - Otherwise ability doesn't determine outcomes
:::

## Limitations and Extensions

What the basic model misses:

:::{.incremental}
- **Multiple skills**: cognitive, non-cognitive, health
- **Life-cycle dynamics**: when do investments matter most?
- **Neighborhoods and peers**: external effects on children
- **Uncertainty**: parents don't know child's future fully
- **Credit constraints**: can vary over time/development
:::

. . .

Modern research extends the model in these directions.

# Critiques of the Basic Model

## The Goldberger Critique

@Goldberger1989 raised a fundamental question:

:::{.incremental}
- Are Becker-Tomes predictions **distinct** from simple Galton model?
- Galton: $Y_t = \alpha + h Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$ (just genetics)
- Becker-Tomes adds: investments, capital markets, bequests
- **Question**: Do these additions generate unique testable predictions?
- Or do we just get the same regression-to-mean result?
:::

. . .

This motivated systematic testing of unique Becker-Tomes implications.

## Mulligan's Empirical Tests

@Mulligan1999 tests **9 unique implications** of Becker-Tomes vs. Galton:

:::{.incremental}
- Uses multiple datasets: PSID, NLS, SCF
- Examines earnings, consumption, and wealth
- Distinguishes families by transfer behavior
- **Result**: Several key predictions fail empirically
:::

. . .

Let's examine the most important failures.

## Failed Prediction 1: Consumption Mobility

**Becker-Tomes prediction**: With perfect credit markets, consumption should **not** regress to mean among transfer-making families.

- Rich parents use bequests to offset earnings regression
- Dynasty persists in consumption even as earnings regress

:::{.incremental}
- **Evidence** (@Mulligan1999, Table 3): Consumption **does** regress!
- Among families making transfers: $\beta_{\text{consumption}} \approx 0.3$
- Similar to earnings regression
- Suggests credit markets are NOT perfect even for rich families
:::

## Failed Prediction 2: Earnings Inequality

**Becker-Tomes prediction**: Families making transfers (unconstrained) should have **more equal** children's earnings than constrained families.

- Why? Unconstrained families equate marginal returns
- Only endowment variation matters, not income variation
- Constrained families: both endowments AND income matter

:::{.incremental}
- **Evidence** (@Mulligan1999, Table 6): **Opposite** pattern!
- Children of transfer-making families have **more** earnings inequality
- Suggests complementarity between parental resources and outcomes
- Basic two-period model misses something important
:::

## Failed Prediction 3: The Grandparent Effect

**Becker-Tomes prediction**: Controlling for parents' income, grandparents' income should have **negative** effect.

$$Y_t \approx c_t + (\beta^* + h) Y_{t-1} - \beta^* h \cdot Y_{t-2} + \varepsilon_t$$

:::{.incremental}
- Intuition: Rich grandparents → rich parents → less investment needed
- **Evidence** (@Mulligan1999): Coefficient on $Y_{t-2}$ is **positive** or zero
- Not the predicted negative relationship
- Suggests longer-run dynamics than two-generation model
:::

## What's Missing?

The failures point to important omissions:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Multi-period structure**: Investments span childhood, not one shot
2. **Multiple skills**: Cognitive and non-cognitive abilities matter
3. **Dynamic complementarity**: Early investments affect returns to later ones
4. **Self-productivity**: Skills today enhance skill formation tomorrow
5. **Life-cycle timing**: When investments occur matters
:::

. . .

**Solution**: Extend to multi-period framework with richer technology.

# The Multi-Period Framework

## Cunha-Heckman Technology

@Cunha2007 develop a **multi-stage** model of skill formation:

$$\theta_{t+1} = f_t(h, \theta_t, I_t)$$

:::{.incremental}
- $\theta_t$ = vector of skills at age $t$ (cognitive, non-cognitive)
- $I_t$ = vector of investments at age $t$ (parental, public)
- $h$ = child's genetic endowment
- $f_t$ = age-specific production function
:::

. . .

**Key**: Production function changes over development stages.

## Two Key Properties

### 1. Self-Productivity

$$\frac{\partial \theta_{t+1}}{\partial \theta_t} > 0$$

Skills acquired in one period **boost** skill formation in the next period.

:::{.incremental}
- Learning-to-learn
- Higher ability children accumulate skills faster
- Creates compounding advantages
- Explains why early gaps widen over time
:::

## Two Key Properties (continued)

### 2. Dynamic Complementarity

$$\frac{\partial^2 \theta_{t+1}}{\partial I_t \partial \theta_t} > 0$$

Higher skill stocks **raise the productivity** of subsequent investments.

:::{.incremental}
- Investment is more productive for already-skilled children
- Early investments raise returns to later investments
- Creates path dependence
- **Different** from static complementarity in basic model
:::

## A Simple Two-Period Example

Suppose skills evolve over two childhood periods:

$$\theta_1 = f_0(h, I_0)$$
$$\theta_2 = f_1(h, \theta_1, I_1)$$

Adult earnings: $Y = H(\theta_2) + \varepsilon$

:::{.incremental}
- Early investment $I_0$ affects $\theta_1$ directly
- But also affects productivity of $I_1$ (dynamic complementarity)
- And $\theta_1$ affects $\theta_2$ directly (self-productivity)
- Total effect of $I_0$ includes **three channels**
:::

## Visualizing Dynamic Complementarity

```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: true

using Plots

# Marginal product of late investment for different early investment levels
I1 = 0:0.1:10

# Returns to late investment depend on early investment
mp_low_I0(I1) = 5 * exp(-0.4 * I1)      # Low early investment
mp_medium_I0(I1) = 8 * exp(-0.35 * I1)  # Medium early investment
mp_high_I0(I1) = 12 * exp(-0.3 * I1)    # High early investment

plot(I1, mp_low_I0.(I1),
     label="MP(I₁ | I₀ = low)",
     xlabel="Late investment (I₁)",
     ylabel="Marginal product",
     title="Dynamic Complementarity: Early Investment Raises Returns to Late Investment",
     linewidth=2.5,
     legend=:topright,
     grid=true,
     left_margin=5Plots.mm,
     bottom_margin=5Plots.mm,
     size=(700, 400))
plot!(I1, mp_medium_I0.(I1), label="MP(I₁ | I₀ = medium)", linewidth=2.5)
plot!(I1, mp_high_I0.(I1), label="MP(I₁ | I₀ = high)", linewidth=2.5)
```

Higher early investment shifts up the entire late investment return curve.

## CES Specification

@Cunha2007 use a CES production function:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \left[\gamma_1 \theta_t^\phi + \gamma_2 I_t^\phi\right]^{1/\phi}$$

:::{.incremental}
- $\phi$ determines elasticity of substitution: $\sigma = 1/(1-\phi)$
- $\phi < 1$: Skills and investment are complements
- $\gamma_1, \gamma_2$: relative importance of self-productivity vs. investment
- Can estimate separately for different ages and skill types
:::

. . .

**Empirical finding**: $\phi < 0$ for early childhood (strong complementarity).

## Critical and Sensitive Periods

The multi-period framework allows for:

:::{.incremental}
- **Critical periods**: Times when $\partial f_t / \partial I_t$ is especially high
  - Investment has large direct effect
  - Example: Language acquisition 0-3 years
- **Sensitive periods**: Times when complementarity is strongest
  - Investment affects returns to all future investments
  - Example: Executive function development 3-5 years
- **Empirical evidence**: Early childhood is both critical and sensitive
:::

## Rationalizing the Evidence

The multi-period model addresses Mulligan's critiques:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Consumption mobility**: Multiple constraints over child's development
   - Can't borrow against future at each stage
   - Even rich families face some constraints
2. **Earnings inequality**: Dynamic complementarity reinforces advantages
   - Rich parents invest more at ALL stages
   - Complementarities amplify initial differences
3. **Grandparent effects**: Longer transmission chain
   - $Y_{t-2}$ affects multiple periods of $Y_{t-1}$'s development
   - Positive persistence through multiple channels
:::

## Policy Implications from Multi-Period Model

The timing of intervention matters:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Early investments have high returns**
   - Affect all subsequent stages through complementarity
   - Self-productivity multiplies initial effects
   - Equity and efficiency align for early programs
2. **Late remediation is costly**
   - Must overcome accumulated deficits
   - Low complementarity with missing early skills
   - Equity-efficiency tradeoff emerges
3. **Targeting matters**
   - Complementarity → target disadvantaged children early
   - Universal programs may have low returns if constraints don't bind
:::

## Quantitative Evidence

@Cunha2007 estimate the model using CNLSY data:

:::{.incremental}
- Cognitive and non-cognitive skills from test scores
- Investments from time use and expenditures
- **Key findings**:
  - Strong complementarity in early childhood ($\phi < 0$)
  - Self-productivity dominates investment by adolescence
  - Optimal investment front-loaded to early ages
  - Explains fadeout of programs that don't continue investing
:::

. . .

**Conclusion**: Multi-stage technology rationalizes patterns that puzzle basic Becker-Tomes.

# Takeaways

## Summary

The Becker-Tomes model provides a unified framework:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Endowment regression** ($h < 1$) drives mobility
2. **Capital constraints** slow mobility for poor families
3. **Bequests** buffer consumption regression for rich families
4. **Fertility and marriage** ensure long-run regression
5. Parents affect children through **multiple channels**
6. **Policy** can address market failures efficiently
:::

## Key Equations

For reference:

- Endowment transmission: $E_t = \alpha + h E_{t-1} + v_t$
- Human capital production: $H_t = \psi(x_{t-1}, E_t, s_{t-1})$
- Earnings (no constraints): $Y_t \approx \alpha + h \cdot Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$
- Earnings (with constraints): $Y_t \approx \alpha + (\beta^* + h) Y_{t-1} - \beta^* h \cdot Y_{t-2} + \varepsilon_t$

Understanding these relationships is key to analyzing mobility policy.

## Looking Ahead
