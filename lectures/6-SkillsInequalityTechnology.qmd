## Overview

:::{.incremental}
- Last time: The Becker-Tomes model showed how ability transmits across generations
- Today: **What are the skills that drive inequality?**
- Three main points:
  1. Measurable cognitive and noncognitive skills explain life-cycle differences
  2. We can estimate the technology of skill formation (and skills are malleable early in life)
  3. *Latent factor models* are essential tools for dealing with measurement error
- Key papers: @Heckman2006, @Cunha2007, @Cunha2008b

# Skills and Life-Cycle Inequality

## The Importance of Skills

:::{.incremental}
- Standard human capital theory: education → wages
- But **which skills** drive labor market outcomes?
- Two broad categories emerge:
  - **Cognitive skills**: IQ, achievement tests, reasoning
  - **Noncognitive skills**: personality, motivation, self-control
- Question: Do both types matter for economic outcomes?
:::

## What Do We Mean by Noncognitive Skills?

Examples from psychology literature:

:::{.incremental}
- **Locus of control**: belief about control over life outcomes
- **Self-esteem**: confidence in one's abilities
- **Time preference**: ability to delay gratification
- **Conscientiousness**: persistence, organization
- **Emotional stability**: managing stress and emotions
:::

. . .

These are often **harder to measure** than cognitive ability, but may be equally important.

## Evidence from Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006)

Key empirical findings using NLSY79 data:

:::{.incremental}
- Both cognitive and noncognitive factors significantly affect:
  - **Wages** 
  - **Schooling attainment** 
  - **Risky behaviors**: smoking, crime, teen pregnancy (large!)
- For many outcomes, **noncognitive skills matter more** than cognitive
- The effects persist over the entire life cycle
:::

## Measuring Skills: The Challenge

How do we measure cognitive and noncognitive ability?

:::{.incremental}
- **Cognitive**: ASVAB battery (Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery)
  - Arithmetic reasoning, word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, etc.
- **Noncognitive**: Psychological scales
  - Rotter Locus of Control Scale
  - Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale
- Problem: **Measurement error!**
  - Tests are noisy proxies for true underlying ability
  - Cannot simply use test scores as if they were true ability
:::

## Wages and Skills

After correcting for measurement error:

- Wages grow with both cognitive and non-cognitive skill
- Slopes are comparable in magnitude
- Some pictures to follow...

## Complementarity with Schooling

From @Heckman2006:

:::{.incremental}
- Higher cognitive ability → higher wages **at all schooling levels**
- But the **gradient is steeper** for college graduates
- This suggests **complementarity** between skills and education
- Cognitive skills have bigger payoffs with more schooling
- Conversely, the gradient in non-cognitive skill gets **flatter**

## Wage Profiles: 4-Year College Graduates

![](../papers/figures/hsu_wages_4college.png)


## Noncognitive Skills are Important

:::{.incremental}
- Noncognitive skills **also** predict wages
- The pattern is similar: higher noncognitive ability → higher wages
- Effects are **large and persistent**
- For some outcomes (e.g., crime), noncognitive effects **dominate** cognitive
:::


## Educational Attainment and Skills

:::{.incremental}
- Both cognitive and noncognitive skills predict years of schooling
- **Noncognitive skills are particularly important** for college completion
  - Requires persistence, motivation, delayed gratification
  - Not just ability to do the work
  - Also willingness to persist, study habits, etc.
:::

# The Technology of Skill Formation

## Skills Are Produced

From the Becker-Tomes model, we had:
$$ H_{t+1} = f(X_t, z_t) $$

:::{.incremental}
- But what is the **technology** $f(\cdot)$?
- How do cognitive and noncognitive skills interact?
- Are there **critical periods** for investment?
- Can we compensate for early disadvantage with late investment?
:::

## The CES Technology of Skill Formation

From @Cunha2007, the technology takes the form:

$$
\theta_{k,t+1} = \left[\gamma_{1k}I_{k,t}^{\phi_k} + \gamma_{2k}\theta_{k,t}^{\phi_k}\right]^{1/\phi_k}
$$

where:

:::{.incremental}
- $\theta_{k,t}$ is skill $k$ (cognitive or noncognitive) at age $t$
- $I_{k,t}$ is investment in skill $k$ at age $t$
- $\phi_k$ governs **substitutability** between early and late investments
- This is a **self-productive** technology: skills today produce skills tomorrow
:::

## Key Parameters: Elasticity of Substitution
The **elasticity of substitution** is:
$$ \sigma_k = \frac{1}{1-\phi_k} $$

:::{.incremental}
- If $\sigma_k\in[1,\infty)$: early and late investments are **substitutes**
  - Can compensate for poor early environment with later remediation
- If $\sigma_k\in(0,1)$: early and late investments are **complements**
  - Early investment is crucial; hard to compensate later
- Empirical question: What are $\sigma_{\text{cog}}$ and $\sigma_{\text{noncog}}$?
:::

## Exercise
Two period model:
$$ \theta = (\gamma I_{1}^{\phi} + (1-\gamma)I_{2}^{\phi}) $$

:::{.incremental}
- Solve the problem:
$$ \min p_{1}I_{1} + p_{2}I_{2}\ s.t.\ f(I_{1},I_{2}) \geq 1 $$
where $f$ is the CES production function and $I_{t}$ is investment in period $t$
- What happens when investment is more costly in period 1?
:::

## Self-Productivity and Dynamic Complementarity

Two key properties:

:::{.incremental}
1. **Self-productivity**: $\frac{\partial \theta_{k,t+1}}{\partial \theta_{k,t}} > 0$
   - Skills beget skills
   - Early advantage compounds over time
2. **Dynamic complementarity**: $\frac{\partial^2 \theta_{k,t+1}}{\partial I_{k,t} \partial \theta_{k,t}} > 0$
   - Early skills make later investments more productive
   - This creates **multiplier effects**
:::

. . .

These properties have profound implications for policy timing.

## Critical and Sensitive Periods

From @Cunha2007:

:::{.incremental}
- **Critical period**: A time when $\phi_k \leq 0$ (pure complements)
  - Investment **must** happen then; very hard to compensate later
- **Sensitive period**: A time when $\phi_k\in(0,1]$
  - Investment is especially productive, but some later compensation possible
- Evidence: **Early childhood is a sensitive period** for both skill types
- But noncognitive skills remain more malleable into adolescence
:::

## The Importance of Early Investment

A review of evidence in @Cunha2007:

:::{.incremental}
- For cognitive skills: $\sigma_{\text{cog}}$ is **low** in early childhood
  - Early investments are crucial
  - Difficult to compensate for early deprivation
- For noncognitive skills: $\sigma_{\text{noncog}}$ is somewhat **higher**
  - More room for remediation in adolescence
  - But still important to invest early
:::

. . .

**Policy implication**: Early childhood interventions may have the highest returns.

## Cross-Productivity of Skills

Another important feature from @Cunha2008b:

$$
\frac{\partial \theta_{C,t+1}}{\partial \theta_{N,t}} > 0, \quad \frac{\partial \theta_{N,t+1}}{\partial \theta_{C,t}} > 0
$$

:::{.incremental}
- Cognitive skills help produce noncognitive skills (and vice versa)
- This creates **synergies** across skill dimensions
- Holistic interventions may be more effective than targeted ones
:::

# Latent Factor Models and Measurement Error

## The Measurement Problem

Fundamental challenge:

:::{.incremental}
- We want to study the effect of **true skills** $\theta$ on outcomes $Y$
- But we only observe **noisy measures** $M$ of skills
- If we use $M$ instead of $\theta$:
  - **Attenuation bias**: underestimate true effects
  - **Omitted variable bias**: if measures are imperfect proxies
- Classical measurement error: $M = \theta + \varepsilon$
  - Bias toward zero: $\text{plim}\,\hat{\beta} = \beta \frac{\text{Var}(\theta)}{\text{Var}(\theta) + \text{Var}(\varepsilon)}$
:::

## The Latent Factor Approach

Example from @Heckman2006:

:::{.incremental}
1. Assume there are $K$ latent factors $\theta = (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_K)$
2. We observe $J$ measurements $M = (M_1, \ldots, M_J)$
3. Each measurement loads on the factors:
   $$ M_j = \mu_j + \sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_{jk}\theta_k + \varepsilon_j $$
4. Use **multiple measures** to identify the factors
5. Correct for measurement error in estimating effects on outcomes
:::

## Factor Model Structure {.smaller}

The system has three components:

**Measurement equations**:
$$ M_j = \mu_j + \alpha_{j1}\theta_1 + \alpha_{j2}\theta_2 + \varepsilon_j, \quad j = 1, \ldots, J $$

**Outcome equations**:
$$ Y = X\beta + \gamma_1\theta_1 + \gamma_2\theta_2 + u $$

**Choice equations**:
$$ S = \mathbb{1}[Z\delta + \lambda_1\theta_1 + \lambda_2\theta_2 + v > 0] $$

where $\theta_1, \theta_2$ are latent factors (e.g., cognitive and noncognitive ability).

## Identification Strategy

How do we identify this model?

:::{.incremental}
1. **Normalizations**: Set scale of factors
   - E.g., $\alpha_{11} = 1$, $\alpha_{22} = 1$
2. **Exclusion restrictions**: Some measurements don't load on all factors
   - Cognitive tests only load on $\theta_1$
   - Personality scales only load on $\theta_2$
3. **Multiple measurements**: Need $J \geq 2K + 1$ typically
4. **Covariance structure**: Factor model implies testable restrictions
:::

## What the Factor Model Buys Us

:::{.incremental}
1. **Correct inference** about effects of skills on outcomes
   - No attenuation bias from measurement error
2. **Decomposition** of outcomes into skill components
   - How much is due to cognitive vs. noncognitive?
3. **Predicted factors** for each individual
   - Can use in subsequent analysis
4. **Tests of model assumptions**
   - Overidentification restrictions
:::

## Example: NLSY79 Data

@Heckman2006 use:

- **Cognitive measurements**:
  - ASVAB: Arithmetic reasoning, word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, math knowledge, coding speed
- **Noncognitive measurements**:
  - Rotter Locus of Control Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale

. . .

With two factors and multiple measures, the model is **overidentified** and can be tested.

## Separating Heterogeneity from Uncertainty

Another interesting use of factor models (from the @Cunha2007):

:::{.incremental}
- Observed wage variance has two sources:
  1. **Heterogeneity**: differences in $\theta$ known to agent at age 17
  2. **Uncertainty**: shocks $\varepsilon$ unknown at age 17
- Factor model + choice data lets us **separate these**
- How? If $\theta \in I$ (agent's info set), it affects **choices**
- If $\varepsilon \notin I$, it doesn't affect choices
- By using choice data, we learn what agents knew when
:::

## Findings on Predictability

From @Cunha2007:

:::{.incremental}
- About **80% of lifetime earnings variance** is predictable at age 17
- Only **20%** is due to genuine uncertainty ("luck")
- Most inequality is due to **heterogeneity** in skills
- This heterogeneity is **measurable** using factor methods
:::

. . .

**Implication**: Early interventions can have large effects because most variance is in place early.

# Synthesis and Policy Implications

## Bringing It Together

What have we learned?

:::{.incremental}
1. **Both** cognitive and noncognitive skills matter enormously
2. Noncognitive skills are often **more important** than we thought
3. Skills have a **production technology** with:
   - Self-productivity
   - Dynamic complementarity
   - Low substitutability early in life
4. **Measurement error** is severe; factor models are essential
5. Most earnings inequality is **heterogeneity** (not luck)
:::

## Policy Implications {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
1. **Invest early**: Critical and sensitive periods suggest high returns to early childhood
2. **Holistic interventions**: Target both cognitive and noncognitive skills
3. **Compensatory programs**: May need to be **very early** due to low substitutability
4. **Measurement matters**:
   - Policy evaluations need to account for measurement error
   - Standard approaches may severely understate program effects
5. **Targeting**: Focus on children from disadvantaged backgrounds
   - They face both low $\theta$ and low $I$
   - Dynamic complementarity means early intervention is most effective for them
   - No equity-efficiency trade-off
:::

## The Perry Preschool Program

A famous example: @heckman2010

:::{.incremental}
- High-quality preschool for disadvantaged 3-4 year olds
- **Large, persistent effects** on:
  - Educational attainment
  - Earnings
  - Crime reduction
- Effects work through **both cognitive and noncognitive** channels
- But **noncognitive effects persist** while cognitive fade
- Illustrates importance of early, comprehensive intervention
:::


## Key Takeaways

:::{.incremental}
1. Skills are **multidimensional**: cognitive and noncognitive both matter
2. Skills are **produced** according to a technology with important properties
3. **Early life** is a critical period due to low substitutability
4. **Measurement error** is a first-order problem; factor models solve it
5. Most inequality is **heterogeneity**, not luck
6. **Policy**: Invest early, invest holistically, target disadvantaged
