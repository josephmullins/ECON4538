## Overview

:::{.incremental}
- We've studied theoretical models of human capital formation and mobility
- Today: **empirical evidence** on how policy affects skill formation
- Focus: social safety net programs
- Key questions:
  - Do income transfers affect child development?
  - What are the long-run effects on education and earnings?
  - How do these findings connect to our theoretical models?
:::

## A Brief Recap

:::{.incremental}
- We found that for unconstrained households, optimal investments *are not* affected by economic resources.
  - Finding effects of resources / interventions, a sign of constraints $\Rightarrow$ welfare and efficiency gains
- But would it be a good idea to simply do OLS?
$$ \log(H_{t+1}) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\log(\Omega_{t}) + \epsilon_{t} $$
- No!! e.g. $z_{t-1}\rightarrow \Omega$ and $z_{t}\rightarrow H_{t+1}$
- Must look for *experimental* and *quasi-experimental* evidence

# The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

## What is the EITC?

:::{.incremental}
- Refundable tax credit for low-income working families
- Phases in with earnings, plateaus, then phases out
- For families with children, substantial benefits (max ~$7,000)
- Key features:
  - Conditional on working (labor supply incentive)
  - Varies with number of children
  - Expanded significantly in 1993
- A few ways to use this variation
:::

## EITC Schedule

:::{.incremental}
- Three regions:
  1. **Phase-in**: credit increases with earnings
  2. **Plateau**: credit remains constant
  3. **Phase-out**: credit decreases with earnings
- Creates variation in income while holding work incentives roughly constant
:::

# Dahl and Lochner (2012)

## Research Question

:::{.incremental}
- Does family income *causally* affect child achievement?
- Previous research showed correlations, but hard to separate:
  - Direct income effect
  - Selection (parents with higher income have other advantages)
- **Innovation**: use EITC expansions as exogenous income shocks
- Focus on test scores as outcomes
:::

## Identification Strategy {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- Compare children in families eligible for large vs small EITC increases
- Key variation: 1993 EITC expansion differentially affected families by initial earnings level
- Use *predicted income growth* conditional on earnings as an instrument for *actual income growth*
- To use this variation, must also control for initial earnings
:::

## Main Results {.smaller}

From [@Dahl2012]:

:::{.incremental}
- **Effect size**: $1,000 increase in income → 6% of standard deviation increase in test scores
- Effects concentrated in math and reading
- Larger effects for:
  - Younger children
  - More disadvantaged families
- No evidence of effects in phase-out region (where income increases but work disincentives exist)
:::

# Bastian and Michelmore (2018)

## Long-Run Effects of EITC

[@Bastian2018] ask: what are the **lifetime** impacts of EITC exposure?

:::{.incremental}
- Follow children exposed to EITC expansions into adulthood
- Outcomes:
  - Educational attainment
  - Employment
  - Earnings
- **Key insight**: early childhood income may have persistent effects
:::

## Identification Strategy

:::{.incremental}
- Exploit state-level EITC programs (additional to federal)
- Timing: states adopted at different times
- Compare children in same state, different birth cohorts
- Also use variation in family size and income
:::

## Variation in EITC Exposure

Source: [@Bastian2018, Figure 2]

## Specification

$$ Y_{i} = \beta_{1}EITC_{i,0-5} + \beta_{2}EITC_{i,6-12} + \beta_{3}EITC_{i,13-18} + \eta X_{i} + \psi V_{s,t} + \lambda Z_{s} + \pi W_{t} + \epsilon_{i} $$

- $EITC_{i,-}$: maximum available EITC credit given state, year, family size
- $X_{i}$: family characteristics
- $Z_{s}$: state fixed effects
- $W_{t}$: year fixed effects
- $V_{s,t}$: state-year policy variables

## Main Findings {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- $1,000 increase in EITC exposure (**age 13-18**) leads to:
  - 1.3 percentage point increase in high school completion
  - Higher college attendance
  - 2% increase in earnings in mid-20s
- The EITC is a **work incentive** and had an effect on maternal labor supply
  - Changes in money **and** time with children

## Main Findings

# Barr, Eggleston, and Smith (2022)

## Tax Benefits and the Birthday Lottery

[@Barr2022] exploit a natural experiment: the January 1 birthdate cutoff

:::{.incremental}
- U.S. child tax benefits determined by December 31 cutoff
- Child born December 31 → family gets full tax year benefits
- Child born January 1 → family waits a year for benefits
- **Natural randomization**: due date doesn't predict birth date precisely
- Average difference: ~$1,300 for low-income families (~10% of annual income)
:::

## The Cash Transfer Discontinuity

![](../papers/figures/barr2021_fig1.png){width=80%}

Source: [@Barr2022, Figure I]

## Research Question

Do cash transfers in the first year of life affect long-run child outcomes?

:::{.incremental}
- Focus: transfer received (or not) right after birth
- Compare children born just before vs just after January 1
- **Innovation**: use universe of administrative tax data
- Follow children into adulthood (measure earnings in 20s)
- Also examine intermediate outcomes (test scores, graduation)
:::

## Identification Strategy {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- **Key assumption**: children born Dec 31 vs Jan 1 are similar except for transfer timing
- Potential threats:
  - C-sections scheduled to manipulate birth date?
  - **Response**: show no bunching around January 1
  - Different demographics around cutoff?
  - **Response**: show balance on observables
- Window: focus on births within days of cutoff
:::

## Main Results {.smaller}

Children who received ~$1,300 transfer in first year show:

:::{.incremental}
- **Long-run earnings**: 1-2% higher at age 20-25
  - Larger effects for males (3-4%)
  - Concentrated among low-income families
- **Intermediate outcomes**:
  - Higher math and reading test scores
  - Increased high school graduation rates
- Effects emerge early and persist
:::

. . .

**Return on investment**: $1,300 transfer yields increased lifetime earnings far exceeding cost

## Mechanisms and Timing

Why do transfers in infancy matter?

:::{.incremental}
- **Critical period**: first year of life is developmentally important
  - Brain development
  - Nutrition and health
  - Parent-child bonding
- Families may be especially credit-constrained after birth
- Small amounts can have large effects if spent on high-return investments
:::

## Effects grow with age

# Food Stamps: Bailey et al. (2024)

## The Food Stamp Program

:::{.incremental}
- In-kind transfer program (now called SNAP)
- Provides food benefits to low-income households
- Rolled out county-by-county between 1961-1975
- **Research opportunity**: quasi-experimental variation in timing of access
:::

## Food Stamp Program Rollout

![](../papers/figures/bailey2024_fig1.png){width=70%}

Source: [@bailey2024, Figure 1]

## Bailey et al. (2024) Study Design

[@bailey2024] leverage rollout timing:

:::{.incremental}
- Compare cohorts born just before vs just after Food Stamps arrived
- Within-county variation in exposure by birth year
- Link historical rollout data to modern outcomes
- **Long-run outcomes**: health, education, economic self-sufficiency in adulthood
:::

## Specification {.smaller}
$$ Y_{cbt} = \theta_{c} + \delta_{s(c)b} + \psi_{t} + X_{cb}\beta + \sum_{a=-5}^{a=17}\mathbf{1}\{FS_{c}-b = a\} + \epsilon_{cbt} $$

- $c$: county
- $b$: birth year
- $t$: year of observation
- $FS_{c}$: year in which country $c$ gets FS program
- $X_{cb}$ :county-by-birth year covariates

## Logic of Study Design

![](../papers/figures/bailey2024_fig2.png){width=75%}

## Main Findings {.smaller}

Childhood access to Food Stamps led to:

:::{.incremental}
- **Health**: reduced metabolic syndrome, obesity in adulthood
- **Education**: increased high school completion
- **Economic**: higher earnings, less likely to receive government assistance
- **Intergenerational**: children of treated individuals have better outcomes
- Effects larger for:
  - More disadvantaged families
  - Exposure during early childhood and in utero
:::

. . .

**Interpretation**: nutrition and food security in childhood have lifelong consequences

## Event Study: Example

## Return on Investment

:::{.incremental}
- Authors calculate cost-benefit ratio
- Benefits from:
  - Higher earnings (increased tax revenue)
  - Better health (lower medical costs)
  - Less transfer receipt (lower government spending)
- Find ROI of approximately 56 cents per dollar spent
- **Interpretation**: Food Stamps are an *investment* not just consumption

# Carneiro et al. (2021): Nigeria Cash Transfer Program

## The Child Development Grant Programme (CDGP)

[@Carneiro2021] study a multifaceted intervention in Northern Nigeria:

:::{.incremental}
- Information provision to mothers and fathers on pregnancy and infant feeding practices
- **Cash transfers** to mothers: $22/month (85% of women's earnings)
- Transfers begin during pregnancy, continue until child is 24 months
- Implemented at village level, targeted to pregnant women
- Randomized controlled trial with 3,688 pregnant women at baseline
:::

## Why This Context Matters

:::{.incremental}
- Northern Nigeria: extreme poverty (70% below $1.90/day)
- High stunting rates (67% of children under 5)
- Infant mortality: 90 per 1,000 births
- Low knowledge of child nutrition practices
- Women retain control over resources they bring into household
- Agricultural lean season creates food insecurity
:::

## Main Results {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
- **Child anthropometrics** (2 years post-intervention):
  - Height-for-age Z-score increases by 0.22σ
  - Stunting reduced by 8%, extreme stunting by 15%
  - Effects sustained at 4 years
- **Child health**:
  - 18% reduction in diarrhea episodes
  - Increased vaccination and deworming rates
- **Mother's labor supply**:
  - 21% increase in earnings at 2 years, sustained at 4 years
  - Increased livestock ownership (key for protein-rich diets)
- **Cognition**
  - Effect on communication, but fade-out

## Effect on Resources

![](../papers/figures/carneiro2021_fig4.png){width=75%}

Source: [@Carneiro2021, Figure 4]

## Long-Run Impacts and Mechanisms

:::{.incremental}
- **Key mechanisms**:
  - Increased parental knowledge and improved practices (breastfeeding, antenatal care)
  - Women invest transfers in livestock assets → protein-rich foods for children
  - Labor supply increases (no reduction despite transfers)
  - Food security improves, especially during lean season
- **Sustained effects**: impacts persist 2 years after transfers end
- **Return on investment**: Internal rate of return 5-20% depending on assumptions
:::

## Interpreting Through Our Models

:::{.incremental}
- Becker-Tomes: intervention relaxes budget constraints AND provides information
- Evidence of binding credit constraints for low-income families
- Technology of skill formation (Cunha-Heckman):
  - Early investments matter (impacts on gestation, early nutrition)
  - Multiple inputs: cash enables protein-rich foods, better practices
  - Dynamic complementarity: early health + continued investment
- **Unique insight**: Cash transfers enable productive investments (livestock) that generate sustained income
:::

# Synthesis and Implications

## What Have We Learned? {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}
1. **Income matters**: Causal evidence from EITC, PFD, Food Stamps
2. **Timing is critical**: Largest effects for early childhood exposure
3. **Long-run effects**: Childhood resources affect adult outcomes
4. **Multiple channels**: Income, information, parenting, health all matter
5. **Intergenerational**: Effects potentially transmit to next generation
:::

. . .

**Policy implication**: Safety net programs are investments in human capital, not just transfers

## Connecting to Theory {.smaller}

These findings validate and extend our models:

:::{.incremental}
- **Credit constraints bind**: low-income families would invest more if they could
- **Self-productivity**: early investments have compounding returns
- **Dynamic complementarity**: nutrition, health, cognitive stimulation interact
- **Multiple skills**: cognitive and non-cognitive both affected
- **Intergenerational transmission**: improved child outcomes → improved parenting → next generation
:::

. . .

Where do the models need refinement?

:::{.incremental}
- More explicit modeling of multiple input types
- Better understanding of production function non-linearities
- Behavioral aspects (information, salience, planning)
:::

## Remaining Questions

:::{.incremental}
- **Mechanisms**: exactly how does income translate to better outcomes?
  - Direct purchases (food, books, healthcare)
  - Parental time allocation
  - Stress reduction
  - Neighborhood quality
- **Optimal design**: conditional vs unconditional? cash vs in-kind?
- **General equilibrium**: what if everyone receives transfers?
- **Cost-effectiveness**: which interventions have highest returns?
