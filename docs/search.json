    "text": "Course Overview and Objectives\nIn this class we will address questions at the forefront of modern economic policy. What factors drive economic inequality over the life-cycle? How are these evolving over time? What are the potential costs and benefits to collective provision of insurance and redistribution? What policies are effective in creating equal opportunity?\nTo answer these questions you will learn the basic tools of modern quantitative economics. We will be interested in understanding the models and tools that economists have developed to understand labor market inequality, as well as in using these models to analyze the welfare implications of various government interventions. Topics to be covered include: dynamic programming, solution methods of general equilibrium models, heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models, models of human capital formation, and modern empirical evidence on the nature human capital."

Students should be able to formalize an appropriate dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model to analyze a question of interest. Students should be able to solve and simulate such a model on a computer, for the purpose of interpreting data and conducting policy experiments."

I will also assume that you are comfortable with basic econometrics such as multivariate regression techniques as well as statistics at the level of Stat 3011. With regards to your math background, I will take as granted that you know how to work with calculus (derivatives). Students should be willing to invest time in learning a computer programming language such as julia."

We develop computational tools to bring these theories to data. Topics include:\n\nThe Becker-Tomes model of intergenerational inequality via human capital investment (Becker and Tomes 1979, 1986)\n\nPolicy implications of the model (efficiency and redistribution)\n\nDebates on the empirical and conceptual merits of the Becker-Tomes model (Goldberger 1989; Mulligan 1999; Cunha et al. 2006; Cunha and Heckman 2007)\nQuantitative and theoretical extensions of the baseline model (Lee and Seshadri 2019; Caucutt and Lochner 2020)\n\n\n\nConnecting Human Capital Theory with Evidence\nWe survey some empirical work that connects the theory with data.
