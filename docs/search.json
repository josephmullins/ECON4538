    "text": "Course Overview and Objectives\nIn this class we will address questions at the forefront of modern economic policy. What factors drive economic inequality over the life-cycle? How are these evolving over time? What are the potential costs and benefits to collective provision of insurance and redistribution? What policies are effective in creating equal opportunity?\nTo answer these questions you will learn the basic tools of modern quantitative economics. We will be interested in understanding the models and tools that economists have developed to understand labor market inequality, as well as in using these models to analyze the welfare implications of various government interventions. Topics to be covered include: dynamic programming, solution methods of general equilibrium models, heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models, models of human capital formation, and modern empirical evidence on the nature human capital."

Students should be able to formalize an appropriate dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model to analyze a question of interest. Students should be able to solve and simulate such a model on a computer, for the purpose of interpreting data and conducting policy experiments."

I will also assume that you are comfortable with basic econometrics such as multivariate regression techniques as well as statistics at the level of Stat 3011. With regards to your math background, I will take as granted that you know how to work with calculus (derivatives). Students should be willing to invest time in learning a computer programming language such as julia."

LATIS provides a copy of julia on AppstoGo, but we recommend installing your own version, since it is completely free and open source. See the website for more details on the language and installation instructions.\nThroughout the course, you may find the QuantEcon julia course (by Tom Sargent, John Stachurski, and Jesse Perla) a useful additional resource."

Your TA may deduct marks for illegible submissions. Please follow these guidelines:\n\nAll homework assignments must be submitted as a Quarto or jupyter notebook rendered as an html or pdf, with code and output showing all required results. You will be introduced to these notebooks through recitation materials.\nFor questions requiring mathematical solutions, you may submit handwritten solutions if you prefer, but they must be submitted as a pdf using a scanner or scanning app on your phone."
