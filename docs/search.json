    "text": "Course Overview and Objectives\nIn this class we will address questions at the forefront of modern economic policy. What factors drive economic inequality over the life-cycle? How are these evolving over time? What are the potential costs and benefits to collective provision of insurance and redistribution? What policies are effective in creating equal opportunity?\nTo answer these questions you will learn the basic tools of modern quantitative economics. We will be interested in understanding the models and tools that economists have developed to understand labor market inequality, as well as in using these models to analyze the welfare implications of various government interventions. Topics to be covered include: dynamic programming, solution methods of general equilibrium models, heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models, models of human capital formation, and modern empirical evidence on the nature human capital."

    "text": "In this recitation we’re going to work with extracts of the CPS-ASEC from the years (1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2019). This is a slightly smaller dataset than the version I’m using in class, but will nonetheless capture the same trends.\nOur focus in this class will be earned income at the individual and household level, as well as government transfers at the individual and household level. The code below loads the data and creates some variables:\n\nEARN which will be the sum of wages and business income\nGOV which will be the sum of welfare, social security income, supplemental security income, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC).\n\nSome other things to note:\n\nThese are limited measures of income and if you peruse the variables in IPUMS you will find many more categories.\nWage and business income is subject to top coding and we are not doing anything to solve that issue here, but you should be aware of it. See Heathcote et al. (2023) for one approach to this problem.\nMany of the variables we are analyzing are assigned dummy values (e.g. 9999999) if they are missing or not asked for an individual in the survey (“Not in Universe”). One should normally check to make sure these dummy values don’t appear in the final data.\nOur measure of transfers does not include in-kind transfers such as Medicaid and Food Stamps (which comprise a very large share of overall transfers).\n\nWith that being said, below is code to load the data and create these variables:\n\nusing DataFrames, CSV, StatsPlots, DataFramesMeta, StatsBase\npce =

You can follow the variable for transfers we constructed in Recitation 1. Name at least one way that this measure differs from the measure used to construct the Government redistribution index in Figure 19 of Heathcote et al. (2023).\nRe-compute this index for government transfers for households below the 20th percentile of per-person income in each year. Comment on any differences with the previous figure.\nIn Recitation 1, we plotted the share of total transfers coming from each of five programs. Re-calculate this share for only the poorest 20% of households (as measured by per-person earnings) and comment on any differences you see compared to the original figure (extra credit)\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHeathcote, Jonathan, Fabrizio Perri, Giovanni L.

The third term is the cost of inequality, stemming from differences in individual certainty equivalent values.

Progressive taxation provides valuable insurance by redistributing from high-income to low-income states.\nRedistribution: The tax system also reduces inequality in certainty equivalents across individuals starting in different income states."

Heathcote et al. (2023), the Household Pooling index \\(HP_{t}\\) is defined as \\[ HP_{t} = \\frac{var(y_{it}) - var(\\bar{y}_{it})}{var(y_{it})}\\] where \\(\\bar{y}_{it}\\) is per-person income for household \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\). Calculate this index when \\(y\\) is defined solely as labor market earnings (i.e. wage earnings) and when \\(y\\) is defined as labor market + business income. Plot both lines to compare them and comment on any differences.\n\nThe code block below calculates equivalized income and calculates the pooling measure for each measure of income:\n\npooling = @chain data begin\n    @subset .!ismissing.(:CPSID) #&lt;- drop all obs where this variable is missing (all of 1970)\n    @select :CPSID :CPSIDP :YEAR :EARN :INCWAGE\n    stack(Not([:CPSID,:CPSIDP,:YEAR]))\n    groupby([:YEAR,:CPSID,:variable])\n    @transform :value_equiv = mean(:value)\n    @groupby([:YEAR,:variable])\n    @combine :pooling = (var(:value) - var(:value_equiv)) / var(:value)\n    #unstack([:YEAR,:CPSID],:variable,:value)\nend\n\n@df pooling plot(:YEAR,:pooling,group=:variable)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis way of making the calculation is a particular weighting scheme that weights each pooled value \\(\\bar{y}_{it}\\) according to the number of individuals in the household. An alternative would be the unweighted version, which looks like this:\n\nvar_pooled = @chain data begin\n    @subset .!ismissing.(:CPSID) #&lt;- drop all obs where this variable is missing (all of 1970)\n    @select :CPSID :CPSIDP :YEAR :EARN :INCWAGE\n    stack(Not([:CPSID,:CPSIDP,:YEAR]))\n    groupby([:YEAR,:CPSID,:variable])\n    @combine :value_equiv = mean(:value)\n    @groupby([:YEAR,:variable])\n    @combine :var_pooled = var(:value_equiv)\nend\n\npooling_alt = @chain data begin\n    @subset .!ismissing.(:CPSID) #&lt;- drop all obs where this variable is missing (all of 1970)\n    @select :CPSID :CPSIDP :YEAR :EARN :INCWAGE\n    stack(Not([:CPSID,:CPSIDP,:YEAR]))\n    groupby([:YEAR,:variable])\n    @combine :var = var(:value)\n    innerjoin(_,var_pooled,on=[:YEAR,:variable])\n    @transform :pooling = (:var .- :var_pooled) ./ :var\nend\n\n@df pooling_alt plot(:YEAR,:pooling,group=:variable)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints for either way (even though I think the first method is most sensible).\n\nCalculate and plot an equivalent index for government transfers where now \\(y_{it}\\) is per-person household earnings (business + wage income) and \\(\\bar{y}_{it}\\) is per-person household income + government transfers. You can follow the variable for transfers we constructed in Recitation 1. Name at least one way that this measure differs from the measure used to construct the Government redistribution index in Figure 19 of Heathcote et al.

    "text": "Consider the life-cycle model we have used in Assignment 2 and Recitation 4. Assume that the income process is as follows:\n\\[ y_{it} = \\mu_{t} + \\alpha_{i} + \\zeta_{it} + \\epsilon_{it} \\]\nwhere\n\\[ \\zeta_{it} = \\rho \\zeta_{it-1} + \\eta_{it} \\]\nand \\(\\alpha_{i}\\), \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\), and \\(\\eta_{it}\\) are iid, with \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\sim N(0,\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2)\\), \\(\\eta_{it}\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2_{\\eta})\\). Let \\(\\sigma^2_{\\alpha} = \\mathbb{V}[\\alpha_{i}]\\) and let \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\alpha_{i}]=0\\) such that \\(\\mathbb{E}[y_{it}] = \\mu_{t}\\).\nYou are going to estimate the parameters of this income process using the psid data from Recitation 4 and repeat the welfare analysis from that session.\n\nRepeating the analysis from class, show that the following relationships hold under the assumptions above: \\[ \\begin{align}\n\\mathbb{V}[y_{it}] = \\sigma^2_{\\alpha} + \\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}] + \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon} \\\\\n\\mathbb{C}(y_{it},y_{it+s}) = \\sigma^2_{\\alpha} + \\rho^{s}\\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}]\n\\end{align}\n\\] (this question requires only math)\nUse these relationships above to express the parameters \\((\\rho,\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon},\\sigma^2_{\\eta},\\sigma^2_{\\alpha})\\) in terms of variances and lagged covariances. A hint: start by showing something like: \\[\n\\rho = \\frac{\\mathbb{C}(y_{it},y_{it+3}) - \\mathbb{C}(y_{it},y_{it+2})}{\\mathbb{C}(y_{it},y_{it+2}) - \\mathbb{C}(y_{it},y_{it+1})}.\n\\] Then you can assume you know \\(\\rho\\), use this to get \\(\\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}]\\), then \\(\\sigma^2_{\\alpha}\\), then finally \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\). (this question requires only math)\nFollowing the steps in Recitation 4, use your answers to question 2 to construct estimates of the parameters of the income process, \\((\\mu,\\rho,\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon},\\sigma^2_{\\eta},\\sigma^2_{\\alpha})\\). Note: you will need to adjust the strategy above to account for the fact that the PSID only has data every two years. (this question requires code)\nHow does the estimate of \\(\\rho\\) compare to the estimate from Recitation 4? Please provide some intuition for why.\n(extra credit, 3%) Repeat the analysis of Recitation 4 (where we introduced a progressive tax) with this new income process and comment on differences you find in overall welfare impacts and differences in the insurance vs redistribution decomposition. You should use the function below, which uses our previous function tauchen.jl to construct a transition matrix \\(\\Pi\\) to approximate the income process above, assuming that \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) can take one of three evenly spaced grid points with equal probability, and assuming that \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\) is measurement error (i.e. does not reflect real changes in income).\n\n\nusing LinearAlgebra\n\nfunction approx_income_process(N, ρ, σ, σ_α)\n    # use tauchen method to approximate the AR(1) component\n    egrid, Π = tauchen(N, ρ, σ)\n    agrid = [-sqrt(3/2)*σ_α, 0., sqrt(3/2)*σ_α]\n    # construct a larger grid of α .+ egrid for each α\n    grid = [α + e for α in agrid for e in egrid]\n    # create a larger transition matrix where the\n    # probability of moving from α to any other α' is zero\n    Π = kron(I(3),Π)\n    return grid, Π\nend\n\napprox_income_process (generic function with 1 method)"

Using: \\[\n\\mathbb{C}(y_{it}, y_{it+2}) - \\mathbb{C}(y_{it}, y_{it+1}) = (\\rho^2 - \\rho)\\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}]\n\\]\nTherefore: \\[\n\\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}] = \\frac{\\mathbb{C}(y_{it}, y_{it+2}) - \\mathbb{C}(y_{it}, y_{it+1})}{\\rho^2 - \\rho} = \\frac{\\mathbb{C}(y_{it}, y_{it+2}) - \\mathbb{C}(y_{it}, y_{it+1})}{\\rho(\\rho - 1)}\n\\]\nStep 3: Solve for \\(\\sigma^2_{\\alpha}\\)\nFrom the covariance formula: \\[\n\\sigma^2_{\\alpha} = \\mathbb{C}(y_{it}, y_{it+1}) - \\rho \\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}]\n\\]\nStep 4: Solve for \\(\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}\\)\nFrom the variance formula: \\[\n\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon} = \\mathbb{V}[y_{it}] - \\sigma^2_{\\alpha} - \\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}]\n\\]\nStep 5: Solve for \\(\\sigma^2_{\\eta}\\)\nSince we assumed in this model that the initial value of \\(\\zeta_{i0}\\) is drawn from the stationary distribution, we can use the AR(1) stationary variance formula: \\[\n\\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}] = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{\\eta}}{1 - \\rho^2}\n\\]\nTherefore: \\[\n\\sigma^2_{\\eta} = (1 - \\rho^2)\\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}]\n\\]\nAlternatively we could use that: \\[\n\\mathbb{V}[y_{it+1}] = \\sigma^2_{\\alpha} + \\rho^2\\mathbb{V}[\\zeta_{it}] + \\sigma^2_{\\eta} + \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}.\n\\]\n\n\nQuestion 3: Estimating Parameters from PSID Data\n\n# Load the data\nd = CSV.read(\"../data/abb_aea_data.csv\", DataFrame)\nd[!, :logy] = log.(d.y);\n\nFirst, we need to account for the fact that PSID is biennial (every 2 years). This means we observe income at \\(t\\), \\(t+2\\), \\(t+4\\), \\(t+6\\), etc.\n\n# Construct forward lags (accounting for biennial data)\nfunction forward_lag(d, l, var)\n    d_lag = @chain d begin\n        @select :person :year $var\n        @transform :year = :year .- l\n        @rename $(Symbol(var, \"_\", l)) = $var\n    end\n    d = leftjoin(d, d_lag, on=[:person, :year])\n    return

Notice that the fixed effect \\(\\alpha_i\\) creates a floor in the autocovariance function (at \\(\\sigma^2_\\alpha\\)), while the AR(1) component decays according to \\(\\rho^s\\).\n\n\nQuestion 4: Comparing ρ Estimates\nIn Recitation 4, we estimated an AR(1) process without a permanent component and without measurement error: \\[ y_{it} = \\mu_t + \\varepsilon_{it}, \\quad \\varepsilon_{t+1} = \\rho \\varepsilon_t + \\zeta_{t+1} \\]\nThe estimate was approximately \\(\\rho \\approx 0.82\\), indicating lower persistence.\nNotice that \\(\\rho\\) is identified by the rate of decay in the autocovariance beyond the first lag. There is a large drop between lags of 0 and 2 in the data, which the richer model can attribute to measurement error. The simpler model must fit this rate of decay by understating the persistence of \\(\\zeta_{it}\\).\n\n\nQuestion 5 (Extra Credit): Welfare Analysis with New Income Process\nWe now repeat the welfare analysis from Recitation 4 using the new income process that includes permanent heterogeneity, AR(1) dynamics, and measurement error.\n\n# Utility function\nutility(c, σ) = c^(1 - σ) / (1 - σ)\n\n# Tauchen method (from recitation)\nfunction tauchen(N, ρ, σ)\n    σ_y = σ / sqrt(1 - ρ^2)\n    y_max = 3. * σ_y\n    y_min = -3. * σ_y\n    grid = range(y_min, y_max, length=N)\n    step = (y_max - y_min) / (N - 1)\n    Π = zeros(N, N)\n    d = Normal(0, 1)\n\n    for i in 1:N\n        for j in 1:N\n            if j == 1\n                Π[j, i] = cdf(d, (grid[j] - ρ * grid[i] + step/2) / σ)\n            elseif j == N\n                Π[j, i] = 1 - cdf(d, (grid[j] - ρ * grid[i] - step/2) / σ)\n            else\n                Π[j, i] = cdf(d, (grid[j] - ρ * grid[i] + step/2) / σ) -\n                         cdf(d, (grid[j] - ρ * grid[i] - step/2) / σ)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return collect(grid), Π\nend\n\n# Function to approximate the income process\nfunction approx_income_process(N, ρ, σ, σ_α)\n    # Use tauchen method to approximate the AR(1) component\n    egrid, Π = tauchen(N, ρ, σ)\n    agrid = [-sqrt(3/2)*σ_α, 0., sqrt(3/2)*σ_α]\n    # Construct a larger grid of α .+ egrid for each α\n    grid = [α + e for α in agrid for e in egrid]\n    # Create a larger transition matrix where the\n    # probability of moving from α to any other α' is zero\n    Π = kron(I(3), Π)\n    return grid, Π\nend\n\napprox_income_process (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nSet up the income process using our estimated parameters:\n\n# Use estimated parameters from Question 3\nN_AR1 = 5  # Grid points for AR(1) component\nσ_ζ = sqrt(σ2_η)  # Innovation SD for AR(1)\nσ_α_est = sqrt(σ2_α)  # SD of fixed effect\n\n# Approximate the income process\negrid, Π = approx_income_process(N_AR1, ρ, σ_ζ, σ_α_est)\n\n# Note: We ignore ε (measurement error) as it doesn't affect real income\n\nprintln(\"Income process approximation:\")\nprintln(\"Number of states: \", length(egrid))\nprintln(\"Grid range: [\", round(minimum(egrid), digits=3), \", \",\n        round(maximum(egrid), digits=3), \"]\")\n\nIncome process approximation:\nNumber of states: 15\nGrid range: [-2.166, 2.166]\n\n\nSet up the model:\n\n# Model parameters\nT = 40  # Working life\nage_start = 25\n\n# Create income grid with age-varying mean\nK_y = length(egrid)\nincome_grid = zeros(K_y, T)\nfor t in 1:T\n    for i in 1:K_y\n        income_grid[i, t] = μ_t[t] + egrid[i]\n    end\nend\n\n# Solve the model\nfunction solve_model(p)\n    (;T, Π, asset_grid) = p\n    K_a = length(asset_grid)\n    K_y = size(Π, 1)\n    V = zeros(K_y, K_a, T+1)\n    A = zeros(K_y, K_a, T)\n    for t in reverse(1:T)\n        iterate_value_function!(p, V, A, t)\n    end\n    return (;V, A)\nend\n\nfunction iterate_value_function!(p, V, A, t)\n    for ai in axes(V, 2), yi in axes(V, 1)\n        v, a_next = solve_value(ai, yi, V, p, t)\n        V[yi, ai, t] = v\n        A[yi, ai, t] = a_next\n    end\nend\n\nfunction solve_value(ai, yi, V, p, t)\n    (;σ, β, Π, r, asset_grid, income_grid, net_income) = p\n    a = asset_grid[ai]\n    y = exp(income_grid[yi, t])\n    y_net = net_income(y)\n    vmax = -Inf\n    amax = 0\n    for ai_next in eachindex(asset_grid)\n        a_next = asset_grid[ai_next]\n        c = y_net + a - a_next/(1+r)\n        if c &gt;
