    "text": "Course Overview and Objectives\nIn this class we will address questions at the forefront of modern economic policy. What factors drive economic inequality over the life-cycle? How are these evolving over time? What are the potential costs and benefits to collective provision of insurance and redistribution? What policies are effective in creating equal opportunity?\nTo answer these questions you will learn the basic tools of modern quantitative economics. We will be interested in understanding the models and tools that economists have developed to understand labor market inequality, as well as in using these models to analyze the welfare implications of various government interventions. Topics to be covered include: dynamic programming, solution methods of general equilibrium models, heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models, models of human capital formation, and modern empirical evidence on the nature human capital."

Students should be able to formalize an appropriate dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model to analyze a question of interest. Students should be able to solve and simulate such a model on a computer, for the purpose of interpreting data and conducting policy experiments."

    "text": "In this recitation we’re going to work with extracts of the CPS-ASEC from the years (1970,1980,1990,2000,2010,2019). This is a slightly smaller dataset than the version I’m using in class, but will nonetheless capture the same trends.\nOur focus in this class will be earned income at the individual and household level, as well as government transfers at the individual and household level. The code below loads the data and creates some variables:\n\nEARN which will be the sum of wages and business income\nGOV which will be the sum of welfare, social security income, supplemental security income, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC).\n\nSome other things to note:\n\nThese are limited measures of income and if you peruse the variables in IPUMS you will find many more categories.\nWage and business income is subject to top coding and we are not doing anything to solve that issue here, but you should be aware of it. See Heathcote et al. (2023) for one approach to this problem.\nMany of the variables we are analyzing are assigned dummy values (e.g. 9999999) if they are missing or not asked for an individual in the survey (“Not in Universe”). One should normally check to make sure these dummy values don’t appear in the final data.\nOur measure of transfers does not include in-kind transfers such as Medicaid and Food Stamps (which comprise a very large share of overall transfers).\n\nWith that being said, below is code to load the data and create these variables:\n\nusing DataFrames, CSV, StatsPlots, DataFramesMeta, StatsBase\npce =

You can follow the variable for transfers we constructed in Recitation 1. Name at least one way that this measure differs from the measure used to construct the Government redistribution index in Figure 19 of Heathcote et al. (2023).\nRe-compute this index for government transfers for households below the 20th percentile of per-person income in each year. Comment on any differences with the previous figure.\nIn Recitation 1, we plotted the share of total transfers coming from each of five programs. Re-calculate this share for only the poorest 20% of households (as measured by per-person earnings) and comment on any differences you see compared to the original figure (extra credit)\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHeathcote, Jonathan, Fabrizio Perri, Giovanni L.

The third term is the cost of inequality, stemming from differences in individual certainty equivalent values.
