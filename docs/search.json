    "text": "Course Overview and Objectives\nIn this class we will address questions at the forefront of modern economic policy. What factors drive economic inequality over the life-cycle? How are these evolving over time? What are the potential costs and benefits to collective provision of insurance and redistribution? What policies are effective in creating equal opportunity?\nTo answer these questions you will learn the basic tools of modern quantitative economics. We will be interested in understanding the models and tools that economists have developed to understand labor market inequality, as well as in using these models to analyze the welfare implications of various government interventions. Topics to be covered include: dynamic programming, solution methods of general equilibrium models, heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models, models of human capital formation, and modern empirical evidence on the nature human capital."

Students should be able to formalize an appropriate dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model to analyze a question of interest. Students should be able to solve and simulate such a model on a computer, for the purpose of interpreting data and conducting policy experiments."
